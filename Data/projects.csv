Maganzo VTC was helped into existence and facilitated by the Organisation for People Empowerment (OPE), led by William Shayo, but it is now an independent institution run by a local committee with the very active co-operation of the Village Chairman. The VTC seeks to support young people who did not succeed at (or dropped out of) secondary school due to lack of school fees or low pass marks. The training at the centre is carried out by two experienced teachers - one with Diploma in Designing Sewing and Clothing Technology, .There are 10 computers, but only 5 can be used because the room is so tiny. It was nevertheless well organised with no trailing wires. Students come in morning and afternoon shifts. This is the only computer facility in the area and local teachers have also requested training sessions as they are going to be involved in electronic voter registration. The Centre Manager, a commanding (but genial) lady and the Village Chair are negotiating to take over the next door room, currently used as a store by some women farmers, and relocate the computers there. The main room (in the fat branch of the L) houses the sewing project, where Judith, the sewing teacher works with 49 young women and 1 young man, but again in shifts. The room is adequately supplied with sewing machines and a cutting out table and there were various examples of the students’ work on view. The block of toilets funded by TDT situated at the opposite side of the “square” has 2 cubicles for the VTC and 2 for the village community. This is an excellent and very successful project.
",12," TDT Committee granted £3,098 on 13th May 2013 for the construction of toilets. This sum incorporates a donation of £1700 from Ruth Edwards from the sale of her pictures. Thus the net cost to TDT is £1,398. Construction of the toilets was proceeding well on 19 June 2014. See photos. TDT granted a further £1,729 in September 2014 for the purchase of replacement equipment. Contract has been returned and grant acknowledged. Julian and Ann visited on February 23rd with William Shayo, LR.  The structural arrangements outlined above are not quite correct. OPE- the Organisation of People Empowerment- is an NGO in Shinyanga, now led by William Shayo with a total of 8 staff. William receives a salary as Head of OPE. He was formerly the Head of Red Cross over several Regions. OPE contracts with donor agencies including the UN’s ILO, the Wabia Network (www.wabia.net) to deliver programmes locally. It is this that makes William so knowledgeable about development issues and gives him a wide range of contacts. Maganzo VTC was helped into existence and facilitated by OPE, but it is now an independent institution run by a local committee with the very active co-operation of the Village Chairman. Further assessment of impact awaits PO visit in 2017.

Makere Vocational Training Centre (VTC), Makere, Kasulu District.
KAYD’s vision is to support disadvantaged youth in skills training, thus allowing them to be employed or set up their own small businesses, rather than possibly being tempted to move to urban centres, and away from their communities and families.

KAYD are now in the 2nd year of offering training courses in welding, woodwork, construction and tailoring.  Several students who completed the course last year have already established small businesses, providing them with income.
Although the VTC got off to a good start last year, enrolment of students was hindered due to lack of accommodation, and only attracted students who lived close to Makere.  

This year, TDT’s financial support has given KAYD the opportunity to build dormitories for both girls and boys, provide a rainwater catchment tank, buy materials to make beds, solar lighting and provide fire extinguishers.  Already, having these new facilities has seen enrolment nearly double.  They are attracting students from further afield who previously were unable to attend due to the high cost of accommodation.
Also due to the generosity of funding from David Anderson Africa Trust (DAAT), 4 trainers are having their salaries paid for 2014.  This is enabling KAYD to use its income to buy new tools and equipment, and to establish the VTC without the pressure of having to provide salaries.

KAYD was visited last year by both Kevin Curley and Phil Grant, and both were extremely impressed by the commitment, enthusiasm and dedication shown by its staff to support young people in this very rural area of Tanzania.  
KAYD report and update me regularly with their progress, and are constantly thanking TDT/DAAT for their continuing support as this quote from Chairman, Mr. Rulakizuye  displays. “Myself I have no another word which I can use and showing you that I am/ we are expressing our unique thanks for your continued support, but only just to say ''THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.”

","2014-05-30 00:00:00",8,49,"Riders for Health, nurses, remote villages, motor-cycles, protective clothing; Ian Gibson project","‘Riders for Health’ is an exceptional programme, started in Zimbabwe, providing outreach health care in rural villages which can often not be accessed even by a 4x4 vehicle. In 2004, TDT granted £5000 for the purchase and maintenance of a motor cycle supporting a rural health project covering Masasi Diocese. Six nurses - 3 women and 2 men – use similar  motor cycles to provide health care in remote villages in Mtwara Region. Thanks to the maintenance system developed by Riders for Health (a UK NGO) all the bikes were thought to be in good condition. Friends of Masasi and Newala, a UK charity, finances all the running costs except for the nurses’ salaries. The protective clothing originally provided – essential for the rough terrain in which the nurses’ travel needed replacing. TDT’s grant of £2200 in 2014 was to purchase replacement clothing for the six nurses. On 17th Feb 2015, the Marcuses with LR Linus Buriani met the Rider who is based at Lulindi Hospital in Newala Diocese. He also acts as the General Manager of the Hospital, so must divide his time between the hospital and any outreach Riders for Health work. His motor-cycle had been off the road for a month awaiting spare parts and running costs. No protective clothing had arrived for him.
This was reported to the Project Officer, Ron Fennell and  by the Friends of Masasi and Newala at a meeting in London on 14th April 2015.

We debated various sorts of water tank and Felix had convincing reasons (for a non-expert) for above ground tanks.  He also explained why conditions did not favour a bore hole, with a very low water table. CODISO's application for a very large grant is clearly outside our guidelines.  However, the group believes that the provision of two large tanks will help those most in need in the village.  Elias was unable to visit this project which is a day's journey from Bukoba.  The provision of two water tanks in the village will bring much needed help to local women and enable them to spend more time farming and generating family income in other ways.

In June 2015 I received a report prepared by a consultant showing that both tanks had been built.  This is on One Drive.  There is a balance of 2 million shillings which the consultant says is needed for completion of the second tank.  I will ask Felix if this can be repaid to TDT.  Felix said this was required to finish the tanks and I was unable to challenge this.  I received a final report on 23 July 2015 and uploaded this.  It showed a balance of 255,000.

The project illustrates some of the difficulties faced by Tanzanian Education Authorities and Trusts like TDT in helping schools improve.

It has been funded since Jan 2014, by a special Appeal so that it did not distort TDT’s usual programme of grant making with project partners. Funds have been generously provided (and continue to be) by many organisations, Trusts, BTS members and individuals who have no connection with BTS or TDT but have read about the project on the internet, Global Giving or Facebook or heard the BBC radio programmes of Linda Pressly. The Safe House was needed because Mara region is one of the few in Tanzania where Female Genital Mutilation is widely practised, with more than half of all girls being at risk. The Safe House is part of a wider campaign against FGM and Gender Based Violence and the Project Leader, Rhobi Samwelly, takes groups of singers, dancers and musicians into remote villages to campaign against FGM and this changing attitudes. The project has been extremely successful to date and TDT has been able to fund a new 10 seater 4WD drive vehicle to rescue girls. The next stage is to complete the Dining Hall and Kitchen on the far side of the Safe House and a perimeter fence.

Fund-raising for the project is on-going and it is essential to complete the new buildings before the 2016 Cutting Season starts in November 2016. The projects has its own MyDonate account at https://mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/safehouse .",8,"The Safe House and Vocational Training Centre (Henceforward SH except where the VTC is specifically referred to) were proposed to Julian Marcus, representing TDT in 2013 by the previous Bishop, Hilkiah Omindo. In Jan 2014, TDT agreed to try to raise the money for the buildings, but with the clear understanding between both sides that the Diocese would be responsible for all running costs. TDT established a Safe House Committee to run a special Appeal for the SH, so that TDT’s normal programme of grant-aiding projects should as far as possible be unaffected. The Appeal coincided with much public interest and concern about FGM and began to attract funds. Two TDT members paid for Rhobi to come to the UK and make a fund-raising and information giving tour, culminating in her addressing the All Party Parliamentary Group on Tanzania in the House of Commons. The tour was a remarkable success and by the time Rhobi returned to Tanzania in October 2014, the SH was substantially completed, before the 2014-15 ‘Cutting Season’.
The SH was built to house 40 girls, but I think the Diocese had much underestimated the appeal of the SH to local girls/young women and although Bishop Omindo gave money for additional mattresses, TDT members also gave money. This was somewhat against the understanding about the division of responsibility but the need was urgent and the numbers higher than anticipated.
The SH was formally opened in Feb 2015 and Julian as Chair of the Appeal was guest of honour. Later and to the regret of Ann and Julian, Rhobi announced that the SH would be known as ‘The Julian and Ann Marcus SH’ but TDT and Marcuses avoid the use of this personalisation, which may well be counter-productive.
Matters proceeded smoothly in 2015 except that in the Summer, Bishop Omindo retired, and as we now know, the Diocese had inadequate procedures for coping with decision making and financial continuity. With no money provided for the maintenance of the SH, Rhobi was forced to use money originally allocated for a food-growing project.
In 2015-16, there were two failed elections to replace Bishop Omindo, a situation not uncommon in Tanzania.
7.	Serengeti District “Cutting Seasons” are normally held in even numbered years, but clans in Tarime in the far north of Mara and the Maasai to the east do not observe this pattern. Hence there was a further influx of girls over December 2015 and January 2016. The difficulties of operating the SH without a dining room and purpose built kitchen were made even more obvious, and the SH Committee agreed to launch in 2016 a Phase 2 appeal to complete these buildings.
Fund-raising was again successful and TDT transmitted funds to Mara Diocese for Rhobi to use with the same team of builders who had completed Phase 1. Building was delayed however, firstly because of very heavy rains in the early part of 2016 and then because it was necessary to construct a much larger septic tank designed pro bono by a consulting engineer at the request of TDT’s LR in Dar, Danny Mwasandube.
In Summer 2016, Dr George Okoth, a lecturer from St John’s University in Dodoma was installed as the new Bishop of Mara. TDT colleagues at the Safe House, Canadian film maker Giselle Portenier (making a trailer for her film) and Rhobi herself began to report difficulties. The Bishop is reported to have said (but never in any written statement to TDT) that he wished to turn the SH into a fee-paying girls’ school. Relationships between the Bishop and Rhobi deteriorated sharply. The Bishop announced that he wanted the construction work on the SH to be handled by Anglican  fundi (builders) and not the team Rhobi had previously employed. May 2017: Diocese apparently has no money to pay for sewage clearance, electricity and water and girls' medical expenses. Julian paid, but said payment would be deducted from any final payment for buildings. and claimed money back from TDT.

PMG 24/06/16 Diane Senior is a VSO volunteer on Pemba Island. Diane applied for a VSO Small Grant of £500 to refurbish a learning resource room at Mkiawang'ombe Primary School.  Although there was already a room allocated for keeping the few resources they already had, it was just a big empty room, and everything was piled up in one corner.  With the VSO Small Grant money (donor funding) Diane was able to arrange for carpenters to build a range of shelving in the room, buy office resources and teachers packs so they could then make new resources.

As the younger learners need more concrete and active teaching to enhance their learning, teaching aids which they have become used to in pre-primary are still essential.
I shall be accompanying the advisors and co-teaching with them. It has been decided that there will be three workshops in total in each district for a total of 130 teachers, one from each school. In each workshop there will be an input of methods and activities followed up by the materials making time. Each advisor and myself will prepare one topic for each workshop and create materials which can be used as models for the teachers.

August 2015:  Jonathan visited for 4 days and stayed with Robert Kasaaju family.  Individual school reports entered but overall good progress in starting to implement plans for final third year. 
New additional input is the Satellite Broadband installation by Avanti and Infinity which will give the schools free installation, free supported broadband for one year then continuation free or with additional download at some cost by each school.  Benefits are that the 4 libraries and one other room / office will have internet connection.  Kibirizi is installing solar power for electric supply which will give the library lit study space for exam students in the evening for the first time.

IKIMBA SCHOOLS PROJECT 2012 - 2015
The four rural Kagera Region schools in this project, named after Lake Ikimba round which the schools are grouped, are Tunamkumbuka, Rubale, Izimbya and Kibirizi.  This report outlines the second year of a three year programme to assist with raising attainment, supporting girls'attendance and their commitment to their education and the schools’ approach to teaching and learning.  The core focus was the development of the library facilities and associated teaching and learning skills, use of text and reference books and improvement in levels of literacy through the broadening of reading matter available in the libraries. . During this second year all schools completed the conversions and renovations for the library establishment  and the purchase of shelving, tables and seating and improvements to security on windows and doors.  Text books and other resources purchased by the schools in year one now have proper display and access for students and staff with all schools using student librarians and cataloguing to ensure records and security of book use.  A successful short programme of training for the schools on using libraries and resources effectively was run by retired District Education Officer Bw Ngaiza Kailembo.  Following a TDT monitoring visit by members Dan Cook and Jonathan Pace  plus school reports  and other regular helpful feedback by our representative in Kagera, Mzee Elias Mashasi,  phase 2 payments were sent to the schools following their submission of plans for use of this  grant.  Schools used this for varying purposes but all within the original overall aims of the 3 year programme.  Izimbya School and Rubale School focused on completion of library facilities and some additional science and sports field improvements whilst Kibirizi School  added books for the  school library, sports gear equipment for Netball, Volleball and Football and a solar powered computer laptop with a steel cabinet for secure storage. Tunamkumbuka used funds  to set up a small computer room.  This was opened with great celebration by Samia Khatun, Trustee of Hilden Charitable Fund which has generously agreed to fund the programme in conjunction with TDT.  We are grateful to Samia for visiting two of the schools during her long safari in Uganda and Tanzania to monitor progress and report back to TDT.  Additional monitoring and project implementation visits have been made during this year by TDT Campaigns' Manager Janet Chapman.  Work has been started on developing a programme linked to Millenium Development Goal 3 to support girls' education and attendance, alongside her work on developments in Teaching and Learning supported by use of Tablet computers Janet held initial discussions with school counsellors on how we might support a programme of more regular consultation between the schools on curriculum and social welfare issues, especially for girls. Jonathan Pace will be visiting the schools in August to follow up on these discussions and also the plans submitted for the third year of this programme, which Hilden have again generously agreed to fund.   A key development for all the schools is Science facilities which the Tanzania Government  have determined all schools must provide by the end of this year and alongside the support for girls' education the third year of funding will help the schools to create or improve accommodation for the science curriculum.
Attainment:  One key criteria for the original aims of the project was to achieve improvement in attainment and we were pleased to receive examination results from retired DEO and ex Head teacher of Kibirizi,  Bw Josiah Karwihula, which showed that for the first time a large number of girls achieved a pass in Grade  IV examinations, affirming also an improvement in the girls’ commitment to school.  This meant that for the first time girls were able to proceed into Form 5, the equivalent of our UK lower 6th.  There was a similar overall small improvement in boys’ results. Whilst there are challenges of staffing and resourcing we look forward during this third year to continuing to support improvement in the schools.

This report is on the final year of a three year programme to assist with raising attainment, supporting girls' attendance and their commitment to their education and the schools’ approach to teaching and learning.  All four schools continued their resourcing of core curriculum areas, especially the new science laboratories for which science equipment including a ‘practice skeleton’ and furniture was purchased!
To encourage girls’ attendance funding has helped schools have provided better hygiene facilities and resources.  A training workshop was held for staff on the introduction of girls' clubs to empower girls to discuss and realise their aspirations for a better education and life beyond school. Some basic and secure hostel accommodation for girls near the very remote Kibirizi School enabled them to study in the evenings with solar lights and avoid long journeys from their homes each day. Satellite broadband was installed in all four schools giving schools internet access with the many benefits of communication and educational resources on the world wide web. Although the funding programme is completed, TDT will continue follow up visits. We thank again Hilden Charitable Fund for its generous funding support for this programme along with our other individual donors. Robert Kasaaju, Bursar at Tunambuka School writes "We use this opportunity to appreciate you in person, TDT as well as HCF, for your great support to our school and the all community at large. For your efforts and good heart we say thank you very much and may God bless everybody who helped on this.”

Small Grants scheme for serving VSO volunteers in Tanzania – July 2011:  Revised  Sept 2016
INTRODUCTION
The Tanzania Development Trust (TDT) (www.tanzdevtrust.org ) is the development charity of the Britain-Tanzania Society (www.btsociety.org ). The aim of the Society is to promote good relations and better understanding between the peoples of Tanzania and Britain.
TDT recognises that some volunteers may be unable to fulfill the purpose of their project, due to the lack of some very basic materials  (e.g. textbooks, basic science lab equipment), so this scheme should enable some volunteers to overcome this problem RELATIVELY quickly. TDT also recognises that some well-established volunteers may be in a position to help their local communities to overcome the lack of some basic amenity before they leave.   
TDT is offering small grants to current VSO volunteers under the following terms and conditions:
1.	The grant will be for a sum of not less than TZS 250,000 and not more than TZS 1,250,000
2.	A grant will be awarded for the purpose of either increasing the effectiveness of the volunteer’s project or improving the lives of the community within which the volunteer is living. In the latter case, the project must include ‘matching funding ‘ in terms of materials or labour from that community.  This means that  the Committee looks for Ideas - Driven proposals that can remove a specific obstacle to the delivery of a project,  or proposals that, with the volunteer’s involvement and community contribution can make an immediate and sustainable improvement in the life of their community. 

Since 2012 around 46 grants have been awarded and these have been reported in the annual reports.  At time of writing in 2017 the scheme has been awarding grants regularly after a hiatus in 2016 following changes of personnel in the VSO Dar office.
A brief summary of grants awarded since July 2016 is in the 2017 annual report.

Grant details are listed under an individual project  data base identification  from 5001 onwards.  Currently ( July 2017) the data base only records grants made since the data base was established.   It is hoped to enter a list update of earlier grant awards to the data in the near future.

Local Rep Albert Kahai has also reported back after meeting Ndatala from Ebeneza. Recommendation going to the May 2014 meeting. May 13th 2014:  Grant approved for sewing machines of £2805.   Computers deferred for enquiries by DG into C4A costs etc (JP for DG) Julian and Ann visited with William Shayo after discussing the previous orphan care project (qv.) and after hearing Joseph Ndatala explain his plans for the computer centre.
Julian explained that TDT’s interest was in Vocational Education which led to VETA certificated qualifications and which enabled students to progress to employment. JN stated that the teacher was fully qualified and was assisted by a graduate in computer applications: unverifiable assertions. He said that this was the only training facility in the Ward- there were others in Shinyanga town, but they were expensive. Not all the students at the Ebeneza Centre were charged fees but enough was made from those that did to cover expenses. JN stated that they would be in a position in April to make an application to VETA for accreditation. 
We were taken to see the computer room. There were 6 working desktop computers in a very small room with a blackboard and no apparent teaching aids. All were being run from a single 13amp power point and a network of gang sockets across the floor. The single 13amp socket was coming away from the wall. A Health and Safety nightmare. There are no cooling fans (320C during our visit) During the frequent power-cuts, work stops and the youngsters are taught “theory”. The aim at the end of a 4 month course is the students have had an introduction to Word, Excel and PowerPoint. JN says the students come in shifts. He has made a request for TDT to fund 5 more computers as in DG’s statement above. These could not be housed in the present room, but JN proposes to use the adjacent office also (it is not clear where the office would then be). JN said that there were 23 students in the computer class, and they follow a 4 month course.
","Taking into account our past connections with Ebeneza,   their responses by email and the views of Albert Kahai our Local Rep who has been in communication David Gibbons would recommend the following;
EITHER 1: We fully fund both projects this is 13,740,000- thier group contribution of 1,540,000 = 12,200,000/= or £4880
OR
---1. Sewing Machine project: To fully fund the sewing machine project which is 7,790,000/= at a rate of Tz/-2,500 to the pound this becomes £3116  which minus  - a 10% personal contribution = £2805.                                                                                                       

NOTE; TDT have received a donation of £3800 from Dr Janet Bujira who would like some of her money to go to Ebeneza and I believe the amount left unspent is almost the amount for the sewing machine project above..

---2. The computer project: To gain another quote from Computers4Africa to see if they can supply 5 more computers. To fully fund this, The present cost of the computer project is 5,950,000/= or £2380. 

Julian's recommendations:
If we are not to reject the request for additional support, (which is one clear option on the grounds of misuse of previous grant),  I recommend:
1.	Checking the VETA requirements if possible and what syllabus would be required and ascertaining what Ebeneza really needs to do to meet VETA requirements in terms of content and premises;
2.	Asking for a drawing of how the room extension would be planned;
3.	Asking how Ebeneza proposes to install safe electric sockets and by when;
4.	Asking when at least one cooling fan will be bought;
5.	Making it a condition of any grant that there is a fire extinguisher;
6.	Asking for a CV of the teacher

It is situated in small and cramped premises in a suburb of Shinyanga town. In Feb 2015, the computer room had 6 working desktop computers in a very small room with a blackboard and no apparent teaching aids. All were being run from a single 13amp power point and a network of gang sockets across the floor. The single 13amp socket was coming away from the wall.  This was a Health and Safety hazard.

There were said to be 23 students in the computer class, following a 4 month course.
Sewing and Tailoring Project
Although it was a Sunday a great bevy of girls were sitting at the silent sewing machines. The machines are all treadle type. The room is tiny- there is no space for a cutting out table. No material used by the students was in evidence and the managers aid that when they didn’t have any, they used paper patterns instead. There were no samples of students’ work on the walls. He said that there were 45 students in the tailoring class, 25 in the morning and the balance in a later shift.   The teacher, who is partially disabled, is paid an honorarium of 80,000Tsh per month.
 TDT’s response to any further request from this project will presumably be conditioned by an adequate resolution to the problems described in the report on C278.

See visit report and commitment letter from Ebeneza in documents.",2015-03-19,"Strengths of this are: We have previously funded Ebeneza and have visited the project in 2014. David Ackland gave a favourable response: "This group *involve the community, *gets things done and *provides genuine assistance to the needy." We have a recommendation to go ahead from our Local Rep. Email details indicate that they have trained staff to lead both the computing and sewing machine project. They have thought throught the certification aspects of the computer project, as well as having space and security for the computers. The computers seem reasonably priced at about £380 each from an Arusha company. They have thought through how the women on the sewing project will take their skills forward such as providing school uniforms. 
Weaknesses: Although not strictly a weakness the group have success in raising funds. With a bit of research the computing course was found to be an expansion of a project which has been started with a US embassy grant.They have been asked by the Village Chairman and wish to expand this from 10 to 15 and ultimately 20 computers.

Allocated to Kevin Curley on 6 June 14   Kevin (1st July 2014) is in touch with Clotilda Kokupima and Benedicto Hosea and will visit in November 2014.  Kevin spent 3 days with Benedicto and visited 5 groups of SAWATA wazee in 5 villages - Herru Juu, Nyamyusi, Zeze, Nyansha and Kitibitibi. I met more than 100 older people. The project has been well researched and will help more than 100 older people to increase their meagre incomes. Benedicto revised the budget on my advice as it was clear from the consultation meetings that older people neeed protective bee suits, smokers and in some cases buckets and ropes.  We met a local fundi who can make the top bar hives, thus saving transport costs. The revised request is for £5801 (using an exchange rate of 2650). Evelyn was unable to visit these remote villages.

Kasulu Youth Development (KAYD)  Vocational Training Centre (VTC) –  £6509
With much appreciation to David Anderson Africa Trust (DAAT) for their donation of £1920
KAYD supports disadvantaged youth in skills training, thus allowing them to be employed or set up their own small businesses, encouraging them to remain in their communities.

KAYD offer training in welding, woodwork, construction and tailoring.  Several students who completed the course last year have already established small businesses, providing them with income.

TDT’s financial support has given KAYD the opportunity to build 2 dormitories, provide a rainwater  tank, materials for beds, solar lighting and fire extinguishers.  These new facilities have seen enrolment nearly double.  They are now attracting students from further afield.

Trainers are having their salaries paid for 2014 by DAAT.  This is enabling KAYD to use its income to buy new tools and equipment and establish the VTC without the pressure of having to provide salaries.

The Chairman says “I have no another word which I can use and showing you that we are expressing our unique thanks for your continued support, but only just to say ''THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.”

In this valley 10,000 people live in scattered hamlets with no medical facility. They dream for a Dispensary, so that pregnant mothers will get skilled care and a  nearby place to give birth, not 15km away over high hills. 2017 has seen great strides in achieving the long-cherished project. The villagers have worked hard and by February had themselves built the large Dispensary to lintel level. The Butiama District Council had promised a grant of £3,000 and full staffing. In the picture are the Assistant Medical Officer with some of the potential patients, including the disabled student, Samuel,  featured in the May BTS Newsletter. Fund-Raising has gone well: last month Hilden gave £12,000 and with support from FOT (USA) and All Saints Church Sanderstead, fund-raising is almost complete.  Construction is now proceeding rapidly; we believe the Dispensary will be opened this year - a dream come true.",19,"The Staff House is more or less complete and used as a temporary clinic once or twice a month. The borehole is still producing a good supply of water. Water is now taken by donkey cart to the construction site of the Dispensary.  TDT agreed to vire funds remaining and held by Mara Diocese for this project’s solar power and allow these to be used for construction work on Dispensary, as the Dispensary is du to be connected to TANESCO under the rural electrification programme. Cllr Masero has sent recent photos of the state of construction which are in the file and a compendium of estimates. He has sent a  summary of these which show that the completion of the Dispensary is estimated at £21,162 less a local contribution of £1,863 = £19,299 and 10MTSh from Butiama Council = £15,557.  Very supportive letters have been received  in Nov 2016 from the DED and DMO promising the allocation of staff.  Cllr Masero has also submitted accounts showing the substantial financial input made by this very poor local community, in faith that their Dispensary will be built. In May 2017, a grant was received of £12,000. A project Contract for a staged payment of £6,000 has been sent to Cllr Masero/HAWAMAMU. A further grant of £2,500 has been received from All saints Sanderstead and FOT(USA) has made a grant of $5000. If Butiama Council keeps its word, fund-raising was thought to be complete. £6,000 sent by TDT in June 2017 has arrived.Good pictures sent by Cllr Masero of Dispensary with roof on. However email of July22 with completion estimates now shows a deficit, Revised estimates requested and received, Total cost and payments to date (inc FOT) are shown on details page. TDT has enough in hand to finish project, although Beatrice Laing Trust has offered £2,500..  Cllr Masero sent further estimates showing a shortfall, but was told there was no more money. However estimates were presented for electrical work which came in at less than Laing's £2.5K and this money was therefore sent. Before the electrical work could be completed, the new roof was badly damaged in a storm. TDT Chair J Pace decided that TDT would pay this. Kevin writes in February 2019: I visited the clinic last week. It was locked up and there were no signs of activity. The roofing boards have not been put up. Doors are not completed. No sign of the placenta pit. No water supply or solar power for either the clinic or the doctor's house, which is complete. A visit to the VEO told me nothing. I tracked down Katengesya, the DPO, and the new DED in Butiama village. He is Alfons Magori (+255753813922). he said they were committed to completing the clinic but would need more money. He said he would write to me with a budget. For this reason I have returned the project to 02, with me as PO. Kevin writes: on 15 May 2019 the committee rejected the request for more funding. No decision was taken on whether or not to ask the RC to investigate the misappropriation of funds.","Notes from a previous year made by Julian: This is the kind of project that could well attract Trust donors and would do well on Global Giving.  TDT ought to complete this project and could raise the money without too much difficulty in 2017 in fact by late August 2017 all necessary money had been raised.

 We have now received a request for funding in excess of £20,000 even though I advised the DED and DPO that we would only be able to consider a small 'finishing off' grant.  I can see no good end to this saga. I think we should now cut our losses and get out. By that I mean we should inform the DED that no further funds are available, explaining that this project has to date involved us in contributing more than £20,000, which was the original budget. If we continue to engage with Butiama District I think the questions will come to us think and fast and there will be no answers. It has the potential to consume vast amounts of human effort for no reward. Corruption is likely to lie at the heart of the problems in Matongo but I don't think we will get anywhere near the culprits. We should then write to both the RC for Mara and the Minister of Health explaining our position and suggesting that the project be subject to audit. I am willing to take these representations on but I will need help - probably from Julian and Robert.  Having seen the health centre and the village I never lose sight of what this is about - the health needs of poor people who have to walk an impossibly long way to get treatment. But we are not going to solve this dilemma by engaging with Butiama Council. I recommend we reject the application, inform Butiama Council that our involvement has ended and write with an explanation to the RC and Minister.","2017-12-31 00:00:00",5,20,"health dispensary","This project is to complete the Staff House, Dispensary and water system at Matongo in Butiama District, a remote village far from all other medical facilities.

Below the Staff House, the foundations of the Dispensary have now been built to lintel level by the local community to the specification provided by the Government.

I then approached Just Trust and they have agreed £ 1,500 towards the cost. Subsequently Caroline and Nigel Webb contributed £ 1,300 towards the project.
TDT  agreed to fund the rest of the costs at the May 2014meeting.",12,"Funding for a hydraulic survey (£892) was approved at the meeting in November 2013. When this came back positive, an application was made to Just Trust, who agreed to provide £1,500. Subsequently, Caroline and Nigel Webb agreed to provide £1,300. At the May 2014  TDT  meeting, the rest of the funding was agreed.
Extract from Visit Report: "We went to the borehole, for which we received much thanks. It was quickly evident that there was a problem with it. The quality of water was excellent, but the flow very slow. It took much pumping to fill a single bucket, thus there are long queues of women wanting to collect water. Apparently there was a previous fault which the installation company GRA sent a man to repair. It was apparent to Rhobi and Helen Carey that the pump was defective or unsuitable for the 80 metre pull from the water level. However TDT received much thanks and we were told that the quality of water is excellent." 
SEE VISIT REPORT FOR MORE DETAILS.","I would strongly recommend that TDT provides the remaining £3,545 for the borehole.

Currently water for the 3,000 inhabitants, has to be fetched in a round trip of 24 km from a waterhole that is also used by animals, so the borehole will make a significant difference to the everyday life of the villagers.

They plan to tile the floor so that it meets health & safety requirements.
They plan to install solar panels and an invertor to power essential equipment in the lab to ensure that the fridges are powered at all times and to allow routine work to continue when there is a power cut. This will ensure that patients receive units of blood that have been stored in a safe manner and that reagents used for other tests are reliable.

JDM: This hospital is in easy reach for Elias. Before giving it to a PO, I suggest Elias be asked to report and also to find out if the local Authorities really want it to be kept open or not and what the alternatives are. If Elias reports positively it will be a good project.  Kevin Curley will visit in November 2014 subject to Elias' advice which he has sought.  Kevin was unable to visit.

There are 24 teachers (yes, really!) covering all subjects except Physics for which there is a part-time teacher not on the permanent staff. There are 9 classrooms, but one is used as a Staff Room. There are currently no laboratories, but 3 are under construction, but very far from finished. There are two substantial staff houses. Both are completed but not useable because they have no toilets. However Shinyanga Council is carrying out work to create a cess-pit and to make one house habitable- no work was taking place and it appears that as with the labs, money has run out. Neither house has electricity or water – indeed both are absent across the whole site. Each house could accommodate 3 single teachers or 1 teacher with a substantial family. There are 2 blocks of 4 toilets for girls and 4 for boys- simple pit latrines, but well built. The cubicles have doors.
The site is pleasant and well maintained, but not discrete- the shambas of the local people encroach on to it and they wander through the school, which is a source of a little friction.
As far as electricity is concerned, TANESCO is supposed to connect all secondary schools. No one know when it will happen.
As far as water is concerned, there is a plan to bring water via a pipeline from Lake Victoria to serve both Shinyanga and with a branch to Kahama. It is due to pass 2km from the school but Shinyanga Council is asking the school to raise 26M Tsh if it wants to be connected!

Project visited by JC and report received.. School ceremony attended by W Shayo LR for Shinyanga. JP 7/11/14.  This is a VERY good school. In the Form 2 and 4 Results in 2014, it was the 1st placed Government School in Shinyanga Region and 4th in all schools, and 147th of all schools state and private nationally. In 2013 at Form 4, the results were 0 distinctions; 1 merit; 13 credits; 17 passes and 4 failures. 12 students went on to ‘A’ Level. In 2014 there were 2 distinctions; 5 merits; 7 credits; 11 passes and 2 failures. They are waiting to hear about progression to ‘A’ level.  We asked about the differential between boys and girls, and the HT said that it was insignificant. Of the 2 distinctions 1 was a boy and 1 a girl, but he did not elaborate further.

What is achieved in the results is borne out in what we saw of the very high morale and impeccable behaviour of the pupils. The attitude of the staff seemed very positive. Because it was a siku kuu, we saw little of actual lessons, but we encountered one lad doing very complex equations and a history lesson under a tree where some dialogue was taking place. The standard of English of the children seemed much better than that we normally encounter.

As a highly successful school ( in 2014, it was the 1st placed Government School in Shinyanga Region and 4th in all schools, and 147th of all schools state and private nationally) with numbers increasing from form 1 level there was clearly a need to improve conditions in the classrooms for teaching and learning.

Visit reports by Chair Julian Marcus and PO Janet Chapman encourage us to believe that TDT should continue to support this school.   The inspiring Headteacher, Stephen Mihambo said that the school has many resource needs, especially water.  Jonathan Pace will visit in August and discuss with the school the possibility a project to harvest rainwater to a large concrete tank, given the ludicrously huge costs demanded by Shinyanga Council for a connection to the new local water main.

OCTOBER.2015 A change of headteacher and President Magofuli's statement on Elimu Bure has held up the projects as parental contributions issue exists:
KC visits in February 2016
Kevin Curley writes on 20 March 2016: I met the Head Mr Manyanda, second master Mr Lubugiri with Ezekiel Kassanga and visited the girls’ hostel.  The Head said the following problems prevented the hostel from opening:

•	Toilets incomplete
•	No kitchen
•	No water supply
•	No fence around the hostel to provide security for the girls
•	No electricity
•	Confusion about parental contributions caused by Magufuli’s new policy means that contributions to pay for food and a matron cannot be collected (but note that at Manyoni SS parents have formed a separate committee to collect contributions, buy food and pay a cook and as result the girls’ hostel we funded is in use).

My view is that there has been a lack of will on the Head’s part to get the hostel opened. I said that if he gets it in use TDT would consider a request for funding to install electricity.  This would be low cost as the TANESCO supply is just ‘one post’ away.  Ezekiel has now informed me that the Head has held a meeting with parents to discuss contributions, completed the toilets and constructed a simple kitchen. All very promising.  I RECOMMEND that we fund electricity installation if a request is made.

I also RECOMMEND that we do not fund any hostel in future until questions to do with the cost of food, a cook and a matron, toilets, bathrooms, kitchen, water supply, security fence and electricity have all been resolved.

I met 290 girls and discussed with them their reasons for wanting a hostel.  They had lots of compelling reasons.  75 girls walk more than 4 kilometres each way to school and 18 walk more than 6.  Only 84 of the 290 thought their parents would contribute to the cost of food.
JULY 2016 DG + EK visit:30 girls are using the hostel ( see report and pictures 06.Met with staff, ward councillors and parental and governors representatives. 
SUCCESS in that 30 GIRLS ARE USING THE HOSTEL + are looked after by staff matron and assistant matron, there is STATED EVIDENCE FROM MID TERM TESTS ACCORDING TO THE HEAD THAT THEIR RESULTS HAD IMPROVED (most were Form 4) as a result:BUT see report issues remaining:-no electricity, security issues as no fence and need for water as SIM 5,000 litre Tank was in the school but not yet fitted to the building; there are still no beds.:- also the official permission from the RC for the parental contributions was still to be received:DG + EK went with all relevant staff to see the SIM TANK and Gutters and received promises that within a week it would be connected to the building: DG made a small donation for the clips and piping that would link the gutters to the tank. DG + EK met later with Deputy DED and Deputy Regional Administrative Secretary :- promised amongst other things to ensure the permission process was complete, that beds would be funded from the present budget, that there was the possibility that food could be requested from next years budget July 2017...see DG Report...DG continuing to follow up and remind staff and officials of their obligations: New Application RECEIVED MAY 2015 for NGASAMO ELECTRICITY AND FENCE; DG to recommend funding the electricity and fence if a cheaper alternative to the fence can be found.","I would like to recommend the funding of this project for the full amount requested of Tz/- 20,175,036 based and supported by the visit of our local representative William Shayo on 10th November. I would like to recommend that before giving of the grant a written assurance is gained from the WEO that the beds and mattresses wold be provided and the toilets completed, with an estimated date for the completion of the toilets. ...DEC 23 2014 WEO has provided a commitment with dates to provide toilets and mattresses and food if funding is forthcoming",NULL,9,46,Education,"Ngasamo Secondary school: Simiyu Region;

We have tested drying seaweed successfully reducing drying time to 2 days from the current drying
time by seaweed farmers of 3 days.
The placement period is from Oct 2014 to June 2015.  The direct benefits are:
A- Improves the quality of seaweed therefore its value since the process yields much cleaner
seaweed almost free of sands and derbies.
B- Increases seaweed farmers productivity by allowing them to dry seaweed in rainy seasons
increasing income opportunity and therefore improves their livelihood.
C- Capacity building. The knowledge transfer allows KIST to produce additional units
efficiently, train farmers to maintain the dryer, as well as teaching local farmers how to build
their own tunnel dryer.
D- Significantly improve farmers livelihood by increasing income opportunity
Leading seaweed producing countries such as Philippine, Malaysia and Indonesia apply tunnel
drying technique extensively.",13,"For consideration by sub committee 8/10/14. Grant approved. October 2014
Excellent report received January 2015 ","Recommended for funding ",NULL,19,NULL,NULL,"SEAWEED DRYER PROJECT.  A small grant of £450 enabled VSO volunteer Hossein Chehrzad, working in collaboration with Karume Institute of Science and Technology, to design and build a seaweed flatbed solar drier made with materials that are locally available at a cost affordable for the farmers. Seaweed farming is a well-established industry in the islands of Zanzibar and plays an important role in its economy. It employs over 25,000 people, mainly women, providing them with an opportunity to generate income for themselves and their families. The growth of the industry in the past decade and the additional income generated has helped improve farmers’ standards of living and provide job opportunity for some areas which lack other employment opportunities. In spite of the fact that Zanzibar produces some of the best seaweed in the world the industry is extremely inefficient. Production is among the lowest and cost per kg is among the highest in the world.   Hossein writes "The Tanzania Development Trust small grant enabled us to help seaweed farmers to:
1- Dry seaweed in the rainy season increasing productivity by as much as 30%
-2-Produce a cleaner seaweed increasing the value of the dried seaweed
3- Reducing the drying time to as little as one day.  

The photo shows a flat bed dryer constructed out of local bamboo with plastic drying cover and piles of seaweed to be turned as they dry rapidly in the heat generated by the plastic cover and circulation of air through the flat bed slats

This report outlines the second year of a three year programme to assist with raising attainment, supporting girls'attendance and their commitment to their education and the schools’ approach to teaching and learning. The core focus was the development of the library facilities and associated teaching and learning skills, use of text and reference books and improvement in levels of literacy through the broadening of reading matter available in the libraries. . During this second year all schools completed the conversions and renovations for the library establishment and the purchase of shelving, tables and seating and improvements to security on windows and doors. Text books and other resources purchased by the schools in year one now have proper display and access for students and staff with all schools using student librarians and cataloguing to ensure records and security of book use. Following a TDT monitoring visit by members Dan Cook and Jonathan Pace plus school reports and other regular helpful feedback by our representative in Kagera, Mzee Elias Mashasi, phase 2 payments were sent to the schools following their submission of plans for use of this grant. Schools used this for varying purposes but all within the original overall aims of the 3 year programme. Izimbya School and Rubale School focused on completion of library facilities and some additional science and sports field improvements whilst Kibirizi School added books for the school library, sports gear equipment for Netball, Volleball and Football and a solar powered computer laptop with a steel cabinet for secure storage. Tunamkumbuka used funds to set up a small computer room. This was opened with great celebration by Samia Khatun, Trustee of Hilden Charitable Fund which has generously agreed to fund the programme in conjunction with TDT. We are grateful to Samia for visiting two of the schools during her long safari in Uganda and Tanzania to monitor progress and report back to TDT. Additional monitoring visits have been made during this year by TDT Campaigns' Manager Janet Chapman. Work has been started on developing a programme linked to Milleniumm Development Goal 3 to support girls' education and to improve conditions for coping with menstrual hygiene. Girls' attendance in schools is curtailed by this and alongside her work on developments in Teaching and Learning supported by use of Tablet computers Janet held initial discussions with school counsellors on how we might support a programme of more regular consultation between the schools on curriculum and social welfare issues, especially for girls. Jonathan Pace will be visiting the schools in August to follow up on these discussions and also the plans submitted for the third year of this programme, which Hilden have again generously agreed to fund. A key area for all the schools is Science facilities which the Tanzania Government have determined all schools must provide by the end of this year and alongside the support for girls' education the third year of funding will help the schools to create or improve accommodation for the science curriculum. Attainment: One key criteria for the original aims of the project was to achieve improvement in attainment and we were pleased to receive examination results from retired DEO and ex Head teacher of Kibirizi, Bw Josiah Karwihula, which showed that for the first time a large number of girls achieved a pass in Grade IV examinations, affirming also an improvement in the girls’ commitment to school. This meant that for the first time girls were able to proceed into Form 5, the equivalent of our UK lower 6th. There was a similar overall small improvement in boys’ results.

Kevin has also discussed the application by phone with the Head Teacher.  The hostel was built with local government money but funds ran out before it was completed. There will be 50 beds, allocated to the most able and vulnerable girls. Currently, some girls rent small rooms in town where they are vulnerable to male abuse.  There have been several pregnancies each year resulting in girls leaving school prematurely.  Other girls face long walks to and from home each day.  As a result they are very tired and often distracted from studies by domestic work. The hostel will improve the quality of their education and the likelihood of them passing Form 4 exams.  Innocent has provided good quality information about the girls' security, the running costs of the hostel and the contribution local parents will make to the project. A matron will be employed to care for the girls.  Parents will provide mattresses.  The school will meet the cost of bunk beds from its own funds.  The hostel will have electricity. The building is 266 square metres.  Each of the 8 rooms is 12 square metres.  This info came rom Innocent Temu - Kevin has not checked the maths.  I visited the hostel in April 2015.  The work had been completed to a high standard.  The school was awaiting delivery of the beds.  By the end of July 2015 the first 48 girls to use the hostel will be selected, with priority going to those who live furthest from the school. Kevin writes after his visit in March 2016: I was pleased to find girls living in the hostel when I visited with Innocent Temu and the matron (a teacher at the school who undertakes matron duties in return for a house on the school site).  Despite the national confusion about parental contributions cause by Magufuli’s new policy, parents in Manyoni have formed an independent committee.  They collect money, buy food and other necessities and pay a cook.  This model was useful to me in other schools where Heads are hesitant to act.

Only 8 girls live in the hostel so far but more will come.  Innocent says that if electricity is connected this is certain to attract more girls.  This is based on his conversations with girls in the school.  I agree. The cost will be modest as a TANECSO post is only 200 meters away. I have encouraged an application.

The JS has already received an award for its commitment to conservation and is well placed to lead this initiative in conjunction with village leaders. The area has experienced deforestation over many generations and it is thought this has contributed to a decline in rainfall. However if the project can be initiated during the rainy season starting in February the trees will get a good start and should be viable thereafter. Local incomes should benefit from the planting of fast growing trees for timber. Shade trees will aid environmental improvement and fruit trees which will improve nutrition and sale of fruit will increase incomes. This is an excellent project.",11,"The need for the project becomes totally apparent on the journey up to the plateau, and on the 2km walk from Rondo College campus to Mnara Village. In the past the villagers have practised ‘slash and burn’ agriculture, felling the trees on one plot before abandoning it and moving to another. There is ample evidence of the degradation of the landscape, with abandoned fields full of semi-charred stumps. It is impossible to tell to what extent the changed pattern of rainfall is due to local factors and the loss of the tree canopy, But it must surely contribute. This project is now in its early stages. To date a substantial number of especially fast growing teak saplings have been planted, and these will be followed by avocados, mangoes and others, with a total of around 12,000 trees.
At this stage, all one can say is that it is potentially a first-class project backed by very competent local people and the energy and commitment of Linus Buriani. See more in Visit Report. The Rondo Mnara Village and Seminary/School Afforestation project has been funded by African Palms and the planting of 12,000 trees is under way. The effect of planting so many trees is likely to have a significant effect on the quantity and variety of local plant, insect and bird life and even local weather patterns. It would be both instructive and helpful to monitor these changes and fortunately the excellent Rondo Junior Seminary (i.e. boys’ secondary school is nearby and can provide keen volunteers. This bid is for a Maplin solar powered weather station, an Airtel modem and a printer with cartridges. Julian will donate a lap top, This equipment will enable the boys to take weather readings as well as the results of biology field work, print them out locally and send them to Redhill UK where they can also be studied by David Gibbons’ students and then for there to be dialogue between the schools.

Elias is the Chair of Governors. The school now has 310 pupils in Years 1-4 and 10 FT teachers (all of whom were present, none on study or maternity leave, and all major subjects covered). There have been great improvements since our last visit in 2011, with 2 classrooms completed and the library installed by READ International. Electricity is fully connected.
This is the school where the payment for textbooks was (probably) stolen, unless Robert’s magnificent efforts manage to recover the money. Mama Lydia knows all about what happened- it was her and Josiah Karwihula’s – use of the Bukoba Computer Centre that led to the criminal interception of messages and all that followed. I did not refer to this in my speeches at the school, but said that they would have the money in February, which I understood to be TDT’s intention before I left the UK. (The whole business of the lap top for Elias was part of the fraud- he does not use internet cafés, and has his own computer at home which he uses with a mobile modem. He will soon be joining Jonathan as an ipad user).
The school has an air of confidence and staff and pupils seem alert, and the level of English of the staff was much better than usual. Everything is well kept, neat and tidy, and the grounds attractively landscaped with flowers and shrubs chosen by the Headteacher. Doyens of visits to Tanzanian schools will scarcely believe this- you can be close to the pupils’ toilets and detect no unpleasant odour!
In short, this is a very good school, well led by a good Head, good Chair of Governors, with excellent local community support- many were present today. Everything is going for it. The Library had an imaginative display about pupil’s aspirations- yes, really!

The wards were currently out of use (not the fault of the Health Centre) because they were being used by operatives from US Aid who were spraying the whole area to kill mosquitos and storing their equipment there. The dingy outpatients centre and laboratory (no water yet) would have been in use had it not been Saturday.
Both Elias and I were surprised that given that this visit had been well notified and long anticipated that the project had not been completed. No tangible explanation for this was forthcoming, and it was not clear whether this was due to a less than energetic approach by the group, the dominant VSO or the contractor or whether the main supply is inadequate.
Many thanks to TDT were expressed and gifts exchanged. The Kenyan VSO presented a document which listed 9 further developments to improve the Health Centre. All of these are intrinsically desirable, some more so than others.
However, I think TDT should be cautious before funding another project. The reasons for the delays need to be explored and the extent to which the Group is dependent on the articulate and dominant Kenyan explored.

Evelyn phoned Raphael Bartholomew (RB) and proposed to his and our surprise that we should visit a Health Centre where bed-nets had been distributed at 6pm on a Saturday evening. When we met RB, he sat next to me in the back of Evelyn’s car and feigned speaking next to no English, when I asked if he had always lived in Kigoma etc. He would only address EL in Kiswahili, even when she spoke to him and said ‘Speak English’
We arrived at the Health Centre, which all closed up for the weekend (unsurprisingly). However, a woman askari opened the gate and RB went to look for a doctor. While RB was away, I commented to EL that I was surprised by his poor English, and she said that many people who could write English well, spoke it badly.  In due course, the village Chair turned up and confirmed that high quality bed-nets had been distributed free of charge and a nurse later said the same.
We returned via RB’s office which had no computer equipment but a list of his Board members which included Bertha Jonas and Venace Ndegaya, well known to us from other Kigoma applications. Any forging of applications could not have been done in RB’s office, but when I asked him if there was a centre that all the NGOs used, he feigned lack of understanding.
On the way back to Kigoma, I told him that I was interested to see that Bertha Jonas was one of his Board members, and reminded him that it was she who had placed the application by the Amani Group about which we had corresponded. The man who could not speak English suddenly became voluble and fluent in the language and told me (as he had said in his email) that it was an excellent project. As he had said that the Amani had Group was not part of his organisation in email, I asked him how he knew it was a good project. This produced a further fluent statement in which he said that he had been referring to his own bed-net project, which had been carried out very well and asked what TDT would do now. I explained that I was in Kigoma representing not only TDT but also ETM/ETW and that I had a forthcoming meeting with the RC to discuss a number of issues and that I could not comment further as these were confidential. He told me (as I well knew) that he had an outstanding application to ETM/ETW and had cited TDT as a referee.
He was still in the car when Evelyn dropped us at the hotel. I hope she can keep her own counsel.

Although part 1 of the project has been well carried out, and although bed nets are highly desirable, I recommend that TDT does not proceed with stage 2.

This is one of TDT's best success stories.Visited by Rachel Lindley 8/2011","See P C166a.",NULL,12,NULL,NULL,"Fundo is a long low-lying sandy island off the West coast of Pemba, and is home to a community of about 3500. It is reached by boat from Wete. We were met at Wete port by Salim Seif and another member of the Committee of the local NGO, Fundo Fisheries, (FF) and soon set off for Fundo- the outboard coughing and spluttering, so that at times we anticipated being broken down under the blazing sun, but we arrived safely, but it being low tide had a long wade in to shore, avoiding spectacular starfish, ominous looking jellyfish and sea urchins (some spikes of which got into Ann’s foot). We soon arrived at the NGO’s HQ and were warmly received for the signing of the obligatory visitor’s book. There was obvious disappointment that we had failed to bring the promised lap—top, because it was found to be defective in Dar. We have tried to arrange with Aseri for a replacement or mended computer to be got to one of the Fundo committee members.

The island has a dispensary (but babies are usually delivered in Wete, or are home births), one or two dukas, two mosques (constructed by local people) and a Primary School and Secondary school which share the same campus. There is no electricity. There are no roads-only a few tracks. We saw one ox-cart. Water (and this was TDT’s project) is pumped from Pemba only when a particular electric pump is operated on Pemba- and this is very erratic. While we were on Fundo, the pump was off. TDT’S project with FF was for the supply and fitting (including bases and pipework) of a series of SIM tanks- large plastic water storage tanks- at various places round the island.

The water tank project has been very well executed by this excellent NGO, under the leadership of Salim Seif and a committee which includes several women. We saw several of the large tanks and the connected water points, and reserve tank which is only used in dire emergencies. Before the project, children, in particular, were collecting water from contaminated resources. We would regard this as one of TDT’s most successful recent small-scale projects. There is, of course, not enough water for irrigation [we are not suggesting an extension] and it was very obvious that the crops on Fundo were of poor quality, and that people are scratching a living. The fishermen try to sell their catch in Wete, where they get a better price than from the poor Fundo islanders.

After seeing the water project, we were taken to see the teachers’ accommodation- the subject of FF’s next application. If ever TDT is to build or restore accommodation for teachers, the greatest justification (in recent applications) is perhaps on Fundo. The problems of teacher recruitment and retention witnessed elsewhere in TZ, must be writ large here. It is hard to recruit staff for Pemba, and this is, a fortiori, even more true on Fundo.
The present accommodation is dire in the extreme, frankly not it for human habitation- resembling more conditions in some Stalinist gulag. The application is for 17.5MTsh (£7,800) and will provide for more than 12 teachers in healthy, sanitary building (questions, maybe about the toilet provision). The Government re-roofed the building in 2007- the only aspect in good condition. The primary School has 536 pupils and 7 teachers, not all qualified and the secondary school has 147 pupils and 2 teachers+ some Form 6 leavers. Some teachers commute from Wete, not arriving if the crossing is rough.

FF has applied also, much more speculatively for building a nursery school at an overall cost of 49M Tsh.
Another application- also speculative- is for help with a seaweed farming project. We saw some of those involved. However the cost is prohibitive and many aspects are excluded by TDT guidelines.
However, if the Committee decides to help with teachers’ housing, this will, in our view, be money well spent and thoroughly justified on a very needy island and with an efficient and reliable project partner.

As soon as the seed beds were cleared they would be planting more seeds. One of the most expensive inputs was the purchase of polythene tubing so that each seedling can be transplanted into tubes for sale and distribution. I then visited another village, Mbuza, a few km away where another nursery had been established. Here I met approx 10 members and visited the nursery.

Julian and Ann and William Shayo visited on the afternoon of Sunday Feb 22nd. TDT approved this project in late 2012 and a first tranche of grant of £2,000 was sent for a cow byre, cows and a poultry shed. Julian and Ann visited in January 2013 and reported enthusiastically about the rapid progress being made in building the cow byre and on the care of the orphans who were to be supported by the dairy cattle and poultry. Later in March 2013 after receiving good reports, the PO, Tony Janes, approved a further tranche of £2,000. In October, 2013 David Ackland, than a Vice-Chair visited and again reported positively, although he noted that one calf had died.

We learned today that at some point in 2014 Save the Children Fund (SCF) had withdrawn funding from the project because they were not satisfied with the administration. (I don’t have the files, but I wonder whether we were ever told that SCF was giving support). SCF and another NGO then built another (and much nicer and more appropriate centre) which the orphans and other pre-school children attend. 

So ‘what happened to TDT’s investment of £4,000?’ was my question to Joseph Ndatala (JN).
His answer was:
1.	One cow and its calf died while calving (? A variant on the account given to DA)
2.	About 230 chickens died (JN said they were given the wrong vaccine, with a garbled account of Government vaccine not being available).
3.	One cow remains and produces milk and they still have 65 local chickens. In a short visit this could not be verified, but William took us to the cow byre we had seen being constructed 2 years ago. It was dilapidated and there was no cow there. William Shayo later ascertained that the putative cow had been sold and most of the chickens.","We think there are two possibilities: 
Either JN  is corrupt and the money has been stolen (there is a car parked in the yard which might have absorbed the money); or and I think more likely, he is a kind of Walter Mitty character who takes on projects that he and his colleagues cannot administer. His standard of education is low (he did not complete Form 4) but still applied to be our LR, although he can’t really speak English. As we were leaving he asked if I would sponsor him to complete secondary school! 
Either way TDT’s money has gone down the drain. What can we learn? 
a.	This project was approved before we had an LR. A good LR might have sussed out that those involved were not competent.
b.	There were no clued-up people like Village Chairs involved, and people with know-how about cattle husbandry and poultry rearing.

TDT is atypical in refusing all administrative expenses. CYN seems, in many ways, a model of how such an organisation should be run. CYN was commissioned to undertake a research programme to identify most vulnerable children and orphans and their carers in a rural district 8km west of Tabora. 30 volunteers were trained to attend village meetings and visit homes and conduct a painstaking survey of the children and young people in their area..  We saw the completed record book of these visits and interviews and it is most impressive. This process identified the most serious cases where children were at risk very often through the sheer poverty of their carers, in this area of very low incomes and lack of employment.

It was following this that CYN applied to TDT for a grant to supply goats and poultry to some of these very poor families (the majority being Muslims) having given them training in goat keeping and poultry rearing. Following our visit to the CYN office, we headed off 8km West of Tabora to visit 2 of the families who have been goats to rear. This was one of the joyous occasions that make one proud to work for TDT and to feel that everything (well almost everything) we do is worthwhile. By European standards, these families live in the direst poverty, in the simplest of houses with mud floors and thatched roofs and living on what their shambas can produce. Both families were caring for orphans as well as their own several children. In the second family, the father’s younger brother had died leaving two children (the mother’s whereabouts was not explained) and these two children are being nurtured and loved by their aunt. However, the goats have made a great difference to their lives with 4 litres of fresh milk available daily, 2 litres of which are bought by the locally veterinary officer! The nanny goats have all produced both male and female kids, and males not needed for breeding with the goats of neighbours will be sold for meat (or eaten). From March 2013 onwards, kids will begin to be returned to CYN to increase the stock available. It is important to note that the goats are owned by the families to whom they are given, and in practice it could scarcely be otherwise. But this does mean that in projects like this, TDT does need to reconsider its strictures about not benefiting individuals. 

Overall from what we saw, this is a project of which TDT and BTS members can feel very proud.  The milk tastes very good too!

Subsequently it became apparent that Adriano Kalisti was not honest and I would bow question some of the judgements made in the report above.

We found this to be a remarkable and very needy project.  Thanks to TDT’s previous grants, the bedrooms of the old people have been restored and re-roofed, including the warden’s accommodation and the toilets and washrooms improved. Grants have also been received from 2 American Dioceses and from a Pentecostal church in Birmingham (USA?). We spoke to most of the old people individually and they seemed alert, strong in voice and handshake and not apparently suffering from Alzheimer’s. Several cracked jokes. 
Nevertheless much needs to be done. Major needs are:
A.	Renovation or reconstruction of the sewage system 	B .Renovation of dining hall and provision of furniture
C. 	Provision of new beds and bedding  	D. Provision of a new cooking stove
E.	Provision of at least one washing machine	F.  Provision of dining equipment

We debated the merits of stacking hives in the banda – they are vulnerable to invasion by ants and the middle hives in the stacks get hot.  Is there an expert view please?

See Summary below.","2016-06-14 00:00:00",2,2,"Milling, Blundering machines for Groundnuts and Cashew nuts","This project was identified through participation of famililies who have a disabled member, and who wanted to increase their income to cover the extra costs incurred by disability.
This group want to purchase 'blundering' machines developed by VETA Tabora that are able to grind groundnuts and cashews to make paste that is used in cooking etc.  Currently there are few machines that can do this, so there is a niche market for them to develop the business.  Tabora is a major groundnut producer and the paste is widely used commercially and in home cooking.  
Initially Chawawawata proposed the purchase of 6 machines, that would be established in rented buildings in 6 different Wards in Tabora town. Explaining to them the lack of funds available, I have negotiated with them to reduce their proposal requesting 3 machines and that more costs were to be paid for by thier own contributions. e.g. food at the training session. If funding is approved, the 3 machines would be installed so that two Wards will share a machine between 10 families.
They propose a 2 day training workshop, run by VETA staff, for 30 women to learn how to use the machines safely, and maintain them.
Each group has agreed to pay Chawawawata 20% profit so they can use this to initiate other projects e.g. juice making.
These machines are relatively new technology and to promote the availability within Tabora town, the group intend to advertise thier new busiiness venture through 6 sessions of radio broadcasts, explaining how it works and the venues of the machines.
By scaling back this project I am requesting £1942.00, to cover 3 machines , installation and training for 30 women.
13 June 2016 PG  Chawawawata group were awarded £1942 to purchase 3 Cashew and Groundnut processing machines, and to pay for their training to operate them.  There is great demand for the 'butter' for cooking and cosmetics and yet very few are able to produce this to sell commercially.  The women have now purchased the 3 machines from VETA and are are currently installing them in their home areas around Tabora, and have received their training.  Once established they intend to use some of the grant to advertise the facilities they offer on local radio.

I made my way by motorbike from Kondoa to Thawi Chini village.  It’s a 2 hours trek and heavy rains meant boots off and a deep wade across a river.  I was rewarded with a substantial lunch including a chicken slaughtered by the generous vice chair of the group Rehema Muhamid (0685 727104).  

Marko Shayo was away at a funeral so the meeting was conducted in Kiswahili.  I struggled with the local dialect.

I met Zubeda Haji (katibu), 9 women members, the larger than life village mtendaji Abdi Issane (‘Obama’), and the ward councillor Juma Noro.  The group chair Amina Msafiri was ill.

I found the village in a better state of health than in 2015 when severe drought meant crops had failed and everyone was selling livestock.  Now good rains promised a good harvest.  The 6 sewing machines we funded were in use but the drought had depressed the local economy in 2015 and sales of clothes had been low.  The knitting machine and button hole machine and zigzag machine had not been used because the teacher identified last year by Marko had left the area.  When I spoke to him after my visit he said another teacher had now been found.  We shall see.

Group members are optimistic that a good harvest will encourage parents to buy new school uniforms and sales will be better this year.  Again, we shall see.  It’s not possible yet to conclude that this project is a success.  The purchase of specialist machines, with the benefit of hindsight, should have been delayed until the project had got started with simple sewing machines and established some sales. I RECOMMEND that any similar project grants in the future be limited to basic sewing machines until the groups have established track records.

The group explained the problem they face in travelling, sometimes on foot, 30k to the nearest sunflower pressing machine.  Every woman in the group grows sunflowers and oil is an important part of household income.  A good quality pressing machine costs about 6 million shillings.  An application from the group is likely.

Councillor Noro appealed for help for an income generating project in Thawi Juu (about 5k up the mountain towards Kollo) and again an application is likely.

Kevin heard from Marko Shayo in October 2017. The sewing equipment and the sunflower press are in use and producing small incomes for the women. See his email on the db. The sunflower press is more successful, Total income so far is 4 million shillings. a press for Thawi Juu has been requested. Kevin will visit in February 2018.

With information from Pastor Damas in Nkonkwa (the village Mwenyekiti before Asheri Stephen) Ron has confirmed that these solar panels are still on the nurse's house and working.

Kevin writes: I was unable to visit in March 2016 because of heavy rain.  However, I have seen the clinic and know that provision of solar power would meet a real need.  It would mean that emergency cases at night - including deliveries - could be treated under solar light rather than by torch light, or not at all.  Asheri says that there is no solar power at the nurse's house - but Ron has told us that the equipment funded by us in 2010 was diverted to the nurse's house.  It is difficult for me to assess the reasonableness of the equipment costs.  Compared to the quote for solar equipment for Kihenya school the prices look high.  What is more the quote comes from the same supplier Asheri used in 2013 for Lubalisi when he overcharged us.  I asked Asheri why he uses such an expensive supplier.  He said: 'We buy tools from a man in Kasulu because he is believable to sell the original kind.  Also we are accustomed to see many important people use to buy solar panels to him and guess he must be selling a quality tools than others although his tools seems to be sold in different prices.

To be edited copy from summary

a Application by NGO, Hope of the Community Foundation, Kigoma, to provide mattresses, blankets, feminine hygiene pads and toiletries to Bangwe Prison in Kigoma town. The project aims to alleviate the plight of women prisoners in Bangwe prison who receive support neither from families nor Prison authorities, in matters of secure sleeping conditions, feminine hygiene and everyday basic toiletry needs. The needs for personal hygiene are critical. The needs assessment made at the prison revealed that prisoners have an acute lack of sleeping mattresses, blankets, proper sanitary pads, soap, and tooth paste. This has caused numerous health problems including skin disease, urinary transmitted and fungal  infections  for women. The provision of mattresses will enable prisoners to sleep in a more discrete way, avoiding unwanted contact with other prisoners and with greater personal comfort and security. Following discussions with HCF it was agreed that reusable pad kits would be the most sustainable and healthy option since disposable pads can cause infection if not correctly disposed of or over used. Reusable pads are only available currently from manufacture in Uganda or Kenya ( eg Afripads or Irese) HCF recognises that soap and toothpaste are consumable but aims to continue to lobby local and prison authorities to improve conditions once the start-up supplies have been made available. The amount for consumables is about 6% of the total budget. HCF has produced a very transparent budget for their application which shows an NGO contribution for local awareness and consultation meetings of around 6% of total budget. They have allocated 4% of the grant requested to a Monitoring Plan of Outcomes. Monitoring will involve a team of four officers, one from Kigoma district welfare or community development department, one from the community and two from HCF. The team will make monitoring visits once a month for one year. 4% is allocated to communication, transport and reporting costs including airtime and internet, stationery etc. Alongside monthly monitoring HCF will discuss the possibility of signing a special agreement or compliance to secure the aid provided in conjunction with the authority's security committee. There is also a plan by HCF to explore the making of pads in Kigoma as a social enterprise or small business and JP is assisting with research in Tanzania, Uganda and UK. Application and letter sent to Hilden CF by JP. Upgraded to include a pad sewing project linked to women prisoners and HCF tailoring capability  for consideration in application.

",13,"Kevin Curley, who visited Kanyimbi village twice in 2014 and 2015 with Linus Buriani,  has written to the Village Executive Officer requesting the phone number of Joram Chilungo the Village Youth Chairman who made the application (16 June 2015).  I have asked about secure storage of equipment, allocation of land for the garden, sale of vegetables and location and content of the training.  Training costs seem high.  Kevin has discussed these questions with Linus Buriani. 5 acres of land have been allocated to the group by the village.  A secure village store is available where a watchman is employed at night. Transport is available every day from the village to Masasi town where vegetables can be sold. After discussion with LInus we decided that training should be delivered in the village.  This reduces the training cost.  There will be a 3 day programme covering entrepreneurship (one day) and vegetable gardening (one day theory and one day practical). PG 14/06/17  See Strengths and Weaknesses below.  Having had no response from Linus, Godfrey Makenzie visited the group,by bodaboda.  He found the group garden was functioning and was told the pumps were in working order.  However being wet season he did not see them working.  They were growing rice and after harvest they would return to vegetable growing.  I consider from Godfrey's report that TDT can say this project is now complete.","Having visited the youth gardening group twice I am convinced of the merits of this application, which is strongly supported by Linus.  The cost of equipment, seeds and other inputs is 8,700,000 (£2,806 using an exchange rate of 3,100 to 1 pound). If we supported only 3 water pumps instead of 6 the cost would be reduced to 6,450,000 (£2,081).  The reduced training cost would be 1,215,000 (£392).  I therefore recommend a grant of £2,473 of which £392 would be for training.  If funds are not available to support this recommendation, a reduction in support for seeds and other inputs would produce a further saving of 1,500,000 (£483).","2017-05-15 00:00:00",8,17,"Youth, income generation, vegetables, irrigation.","A grant of 11,775,000 has been requested so that the youth gardening group can purchase water pumps, pipes, other equipment, seeds, fertilisers, insecticide and a training opportunity.

A recommendation to come to February 2017 meeting for TDT to fund.","This is an application from the Organisation of Special Needs Education Teachers (OSNET) to provide funding for a soap making project in Musoma Technical Secondary School. There is also a second request to provide funding for a wheel chair for one of the students.
This is a good application which I think TDT should fund if possible. The project will provide appropriate, educational and useful occupation for a group of disabled students and has the potential to generate an income. OSNET have received advice from SIDO about setting up the project and can bring them in for advice if they have technical problems. Both Rhobi and Janet have visited and confirm OSNET are a well run organisation and would support the application.
However the application is for quite a large amount of materials. Given that this is a completely new project, my recommendation is that we only provide funds for a small scale start up project so they can find out if the whole process is viable. I therefore recommend that we provide £500 at this point. That would be within the range of of other grants for the start up costs of soap making projects.
The other part of the application would provide a wheelchair to a disabled student that would enable him to get around the school to a much greater extent that he can now.

Extra from original summary

The project is to connect the school to the mains water supply that is 1.5km away.  After a visit and first enquiries the Head was able to reduce the original amount to the second application request, with local community labour to dig trench and lay pipes.  Following further enquiries by JP the head has submitted a new B of Q showing a reduced amount for trench back filling etc using local community labour reducing the budget further to under £3,000.   The examination results, although they reflect the national change in results this year due to changes in grade boundaries by the Government they still show that the school is performing well under the very good leadership of the head and a committed Board Chairman whom I met in August.  The school has recently received a World Bank grant for 18 toilet holes but without any water supply.   This project will improve the sanitary conditions, especially for girls, making the provision of water even more .

JP 1 August.  Successful completion report, invoices and photos received from S Mihambo.  Filed in docs.  ","I recommend this application for funding.

Obadiah has received funding from a British donor called Lizzie Nichols who has spent time in Kasulu.  This has been used to build a large house with 9 rooms outside Nyasha village, about 8k from Kasulu town.  I visited the house which needs windows and doors.  The plot also contains two classrooms, 3 toilets and a well.

The needs of these street boys are quite desparate but I fear this house in Nyasha will prove to be an expensive failure.  There is no plan in place to secure funding for food, running costs, teachers and a matron.  The plot is ‘porini kabisa’ and I think most of the boys will quickly return to the streets of Kasulu rather than stay in this remote place with nothing to do after dark.  I hope I’m wrong.

Kevin visited again in February 2017.  See photos of Obadiah at home with his family, including one boy from the street who he has adopted. See also photos of Joseph with his toe nails destroyed by jiggers - a common hazard for street children.  And there's a photo of some of the children washing their clothes in the river after I bought soap.  Getting these boys home or 'rehomed' with other families is achievable with cash, clothes and things like a mattress and net.  Keeping them off the streets is more difficult.  One of the boys - Augustino - taken home had drifted back to the streets because he was unhappy to be used as a daily baby sitter for young children by his single mother who needed to go out to work.  When I saw the dire poverty of some of the boys' homes it was easy to understand why life in the city centre streets of Kasulu, with friends and bright lights and access to the video halls is more attractive.","After further discussion with Obadiah at ANCO, who has now involved the District Social Welfare Officer, and our representative Benedicto Hosea I would like to support a different approach with some of the boys.  The emphasis will be on finding members of their extended families or communities who are willing to offer them a home. Small sums are needed to transport them to their relatives, provide them with new clothes and support the new arrangements with things such as a mattress and mosquito net.  Small sums would also be used in some cases to enable the youngsters to begin some petty trading. I enabled one boy to return to his family in Kigoma by paying for some new clothes, his bus fare and mosquito nets for the family.
I recommend a small grant of £600.  This will be sufficient to test the approach with 6 or 7 boys.  I will maintain close contact with Obadiah at ANCO and visit again in January 2017.  Benedicto will also monitor Obadiah's work.
November 2016.  Obadiah has reported on the success of this new approach.  The report is available to committee members meeting on 22 February 2017. Several boys have been successfully placed in families and away from the dangers of the Kasulu streets.  I now wish to recommend a second small grant of £600 so that ANCO can continue this important work.  By 22 February 2017 I will have visited ANCO and been to the new homes of the former street children to see whether they are going to school or trading or both and to find out what additional needs they have.  I am very pleased with ANCO's progress and want to thank all committee members for supporting this project despite the risk that it would fail.
On 13 June 2017 Obadiah reported on ANCO's use of the second £600 to find homes for 7 more Kasulu street children and support a larger number in other ways. The excellent report is on the db.  ANCO have requested a further grant of £600 to continue this effective work with very vulnerable children and I recommend that members approve the grant at the September 2017 meeting. Under Obadiah's leadership and with small amounts of money ANCO is improving the lives of some very deprived children.

Sometimes a small amount of money is all it takes to enable a boy to return to his village or to join another family.  Clean clothes, a primary school unform, a mattress, a mosquito net and bus fares for the child and an ANCO carer can enable a home to be found.

Proposal to install 750W solar panel on the village dispensary and 240W on the staff houses.  I visited the Marumba village clini in December 2014, when I met the clinical officer, the village mtendaji and members of the clinic committee with Linus Buriani, our regional rep.  After this visit the village applied for a grant to build an underground water tank at the clinic.  TDT funded this and the tank has been completed.  There is no solar power at the clinic.  This is needed to power the fridge which will enable vaccines to be kept at the right temperature.  It will also power lights so that deliveries can take place after dark more safely and emergency cases can be dealt with without the need to treat by torchlight.  Power will also be supplied to the two staff houses nearby, where the clinical officer and nurse live.  Linus has made a convincing case for this.  It is difficult to attract professional people to work in Marumba, a remote village with poor facilities.  If they arrive it is difficult to keep them in post for long.

From the Website " AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

• To provide access to vocational skills for disadvantaged young people

• To teach deaf youths and their parents sign language

• To increasing self-esteem, confidence and communication for young people with disabilities

• To support the wider community of people with disabilities of Mara with a safe place to visit and seek support such as medical referrals, mobility aid production, information on their rights and entitlements.

 

WHY WE DO IT?

According to the World Health Organisation, 10% of the population of Tanzania are disabled. This is due to a number of factors such as poor health conditions, a lack of treatment for polio, malaria and meningitis, mishandling at birth, traditional practices and gender inequality. There are very few medical and rehabilitation services in place for people with disabilities – in the Mara region with a population of over a million, there is only 1 physiotherapist, 85% of the disabled population in Mara are unable to access education beyond primary school, 50% of whom have not attended school at all. The centre not only teaches essential life skills such as sign language and vocational skills but also works to change perceptions of disability."

It has been an uphill struggle to try to raise awareness, Universities even in Tanzania do not lend themselves to being something for which people respond to fundraising. We three original trustees want to close the charity, the overheads in time and effort do not justify the income which we receive. My two co-trustees are anxious to step down and the only volunteers to take over would be trustees in name only.

However, the University are starting a fundraising push and want to have a conduit in each of the countries in which they have contacts for funds to be sent and Gift Aid claimed; this was indeed the main reason for setting up the UK Friends initially. Experience tells me that the response to the push is not likely to be great at least in the number of donations.

Would you be willing to consider making the UK Friends one of the ‘private charities’ which TDT looks after? If you are willing then we would close the UK Friends as a charity and organisation which can claim Gift Aid. Money usually comes in when someone from the University has made contact with a specific individual or organisation who give a one-off donation as a result of that contact. Otherwise an elderly lady from my church always gives £5 or £10 for the University when I help her with her computer – that has been well received as the source of paying expenses, usually bank charges, since all other donations have been very specifically earmarked "

He said he would assess this request after receiving the receipts. Later: Kevin is satisfied with Marko's account of how he used the grant awarded for sewing equipment.  I asked Ezekiel to discuss the application with Marko Shayo.  Here is Ezekiel's report:
Dear Kevin

I hope that you are fine and may be preparing your reports for the coming TDT meeting in May. Thank you for sharing with me the project in Thawi chini. The idea is good and I hope it will work to emancipate the women and other community members. It may help to solve the problem which is also in Maswa. Buyers from big towns are coming during harvest time to buy farmers products wholesale and live them growers empty and suffering. In turn they star importing products which can be locally processed or manufacture. It will help to increase the value of their products. Instead of selling  seeds they can sell well filtered and packed oil.
Based on my interview and conversation with Mr. Marko, I’m convinced to believe that the project is worth to be funded. It will help much especially when they can seek advice and support from SIDO for packaging, and Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority (TFDA) for licensing. In a long run they can ask Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) for training and licensing hence have a small factory producing oil which is national and internationally accepted. National wise, the demand for sunflower oil is higher than supply. After one year, they can encourage the community to produce more and more hence commercialize sunflower production in Thawi and other villages around.
I recommend for proper record keeping when they start production. Frequent auditing should be done by involving group leaders and village leaders. They should plan to have bank account and deposit the money into bank account as means of proper storage of their money. They should have defined policy and set good agreement with the person who will be operating the machine.
They agreed to start with hand operating machine and simple filter but with a plan to improve when the project start making profit. I think this is good decision so long the same machine can be fixed with the electric motor in the future.
I interviewed Mr. Marko but I failed to talk with Watendaji because their phones are not reachable all the time. I asked Marko about that but he said that mobile network is always down in Thawi. So, all my recommendations are basing on my observation and conversation with Mr. Marko. I added some questions to explore more information on the project.
 I kindly wish to share the answers based on your questions as follows;

1.Why not buy hand operated machines?  These would need less spare.
Electricity machine is heavy duty and will work more efficiently than hand operated machine hence enable the women to produce big quantity of oil per day and serve bigger community around the village who will come for the same service. Additionally, the spare parts are available especially by the supplier of the machines in Morogoro. However, the machine as indicated in the invoice is both electric and hand operating. The organization will opt to hand operate until they make profit from the establish business hence be able to buy and install electric motor.
 They said that the machine is locally   assembled here in Tanzania (Morogoro) and they have seen how it work in other areas. They involved the community development officer to study on the efficiency of the same machine.
They went further saying that the supplier gives a warrant of one year. Any break down or failure of the machine within one year will be solved by the supplier.

2 What is the name of the person who knows how to operate these machines?
Shadrack Omary knows and has experience in operating the machine. He was working in some place in Morogoro but he is now in Thawi Chini.
 
3 Who will teach the women how to use these machines?
Mr shadrack will teach them to operate the machine, and other person who we will get from town to help Mr shadrack for experience sharing.
4 Is there a fundi in the village who can repair them?  If not, where is the fundi?
Mr. Shadrack is said to have skills and experience in repairing the machine. This will help to reduce costs for hiring another person for repairing. Repairing of the machine will be part of his job.
 
5 Why do you need a motorised filter press?  Why not have a simple
Simple method can be used due to limited budget but motorized is much recommended for its efficiency and cleanness. The organization can make it a priority when manage to make a profit from the project. So, they opened to use simple filter at the beginning with focus to improve in the future.
6 What quantity of seed is produced in Thawi Chini and Thawi Juu?  Are you sure there is enough seed to justify buying these expensive machines?
Thawi chini and juu are producing more than  600 for sacks which they used to sell outside the village, we will get sunflower seeds from other places / villages who will come  to buy our service. Additionally, we will advertise our service and promote it to other villages.
 
7 Is there a market for the oil?  Will you sell the oil in the villages?  If not, where will you sell the oil?
The market for the oil is high as many people use sunflower oil for domestic use as they healthy recommended, we will be able to sell in the village for Tsh 14,000 for 5 litres and in town in whole sale and retail. Sunflower oil are high demanded because are believed to be cholesterol free.
 
8 Who will carry out routine cleaning and maintenance of the machines?
The Person responsible for operating it and the women who will be trained by him.
? Show original message 









The machine will be stored in one house provided by Ward councillor. He promised to provide a house as a means of supporting this initiative in empowering women and the community. The house has local watchman who will be responsible to guarantee security of the house, machine, raw materials (sunflower seeds) and products (oil).

10 Which source of electricity you plan to use and how secure is it?
TANESCO source which is already in the village, we wait for wiring and installation.  .
11 How and why Mtendaji Obama B and Hassan Saidi were involved? Are other village/ward leaders involved? How and Why?
.
These are local government and village leaders and help the project so far.  They will help much in project security, because they have authority and power to intervene and control any misuse or corruption in running the project which is basically for community development. They can also link the project with the government support and scheme when chances arise. They have power to mobilize community members to increase production of sunflowers and use the project. They can advice community members to stop selling seeds and restrict the buyers who are always paying very low price.
Yes, Ward councillor has been involved to support the project. He promised to provide a house where the machine will be installed.
 
Many thanks to you

?","The new request comes out of Kevin's discussion with women members of the sewing group in Thawi Chini in March 2016.  They explained that every women grows sunflowers and takes seeds for pressing to the nearest machine 30k away.  This is a difficult journey and is sometimes undertaken on foot.  By providing a pressing machine in the village - to serve both Thawi Chini and Thawi Juu - the women would contribute to local economic development and produce an income for their group (called Muyowirude).  They would also avoid the long journeys currently required.  I checked with a larger group of women in the village and every one said that they grew sunflowers for oil.  It seems this is a hardy plant that can cope with the arid conditions in this part of Kondoa district.  I was also shown the room where the machine would be located in Thawi Chini.  As always I was assured that part of the income would be kept to meet the cost of future repairs and spare parts.  We will see whether this happens.  Marko's presence as a development worker means that there is a chance that they will attend to routine maintenance of the machine.  I had been warned that cheap Chinese machines are available on the market.  I urged them to look for a machine with higher specifications and this they have done.  That is why the quote for German equipment is for a higher amount than the original application.  I discussed the application with the Thawi Chini mtendaji and the ward councillor.  Both are strongly in support.  This project could make a real improvement to the economy of these two small villages.

I recommend that we award Muyowirude a grant of £2103 for the purchase of sunflower seed pressing equipment, namely a filter press and oil expeller.  These will be hand operated machines.  The group will purchase motors as the business grows.This amount would cover the cost of transport from Morogoro and installation and training.  The project has strong support from Ezekiel Kassanga who discussed it with the applicants as we have no regional rep.","2016-07-31 00:00:00",6,42,"income generation Agriculture Women","Muyowirude is the name of a small development group led by women in the village of Thawi Chini in Kondoa district.  I went to meet them in March.  It's a tough journey by motorbike for 30 miles from Kondoa and involved wading through a flooded river.  The village is in an arid area where the maize crop is vulnerable to drought.  All the women grow sunflowers which cope well with arid conditions.  Seeds are pressed to make cooking oil for their own use and for sale. They explained to me that the nearest pressing machine was 19 miles away, a difficult journey often undertaken on foot.  By purchasing hand operated pressing and filtering machines for the viilages of Thawi Chini and Thawi Juu it was clear we could help the women to increase their incomes.  A grant of £2103 was awarded.

In October 2017 Kevin heard from Marko Shayo. The press is a success and total income so far is 4 million shillings. a press has now been requested fro Thawi Juu.

I was not able to assess it because I needed feedback following our grants to Muyowirude for purchase of a sunflower press and sewing equipment for Thawi Chini village. I have now received this. Incomes to village women from use of the sewing and knitting machines have been very small and do not justify purchase of more equipment for Thawi Juu, which is 8k away. I recommend that we reject this part of the application (£1362). However, the sunflower press has been a real success. Total income to the women so far exceeds 4 million. There is high demand for the press. The case was made in 2016 for a motorised machine given the high volume of demand. Everyone grows sunflowers which thrive in the arid climate of this part of Kondoa. I have discussed the rationale behind the purchase of a second machine for Thawi Juu with Marko Shayo who works with Muyowirude. He in turn has discussed my questins with the diwani for the kata and village and group leaders. I am satisfied that there is a case for funding a press for Juu given the distance between the villages, the fact that Juu is up in the mountains high above Chini and the high demand. The provision of a machine in Juu will also open up access to seed pressing to different villages in the mountains. Shayo assures me that there will be little loss of business for the women in Chini.

I visited this well organised women's sewing group with 12 members in Manyoni town in February 2017. Compared to the village women's groups I met the following day these women are relatively well off.  A good example of the urban/rural divide.  There is no facility in Manyoni for training young people in sewing.  Because this group seemed genuinely keen to teach primary school leavers to sew after they have expanded their business I have given them a priority 2 recommendation.  They currently have 4 sewing machines. They have thought through how to expand their business and sell more clothes.  Nevertheless, their request for £5015 is excessive and some prices are inflated, under the influence of the ambitious community development officer for Manyoni Heri Sagali.  I recommend a grant of £2112 so that they can buy 6 more sewing machines, a sweater knitting machine, an overlock machine for making buttonholes and an embroidery machine, subject to their confirming that they have made plans to recruit young trainees.

WOWAP are requesting 16.5 million /=  to set up a poultry project for vulnerable women in Veyula, Dodoma.  This is a well established organisation assisting women’s projects in urban Dodoma.
Their application includes building of poultry houses, buying both layers and broilers, feed etc and give training to the selected women.  They are also asking for an incubator to be able to expand the enterprise to other groups of women once established.  This is an ambitious project, and I have questioned them about the outlay with women who have only limited experience of keeping poultry in relatively small numbers at village level. They have explained that the training would give them the experience.   I suggested ways to considerably reduce the budget and they readily agreed.  This would completely change their objectives, but told me that getting something was better than nothing. 
Having discussed the project with WOWAP I have found that their ideas are poorly considered and researched. They have not attempted to involve District Livestock or Vet. Officers.  Decisions on how to implement it is dependent on when and if they get funding.  WOWAP's monthly expenditure is considerably less than the large monthly income they declared on their application form.  It would appear that they could fund this project themselves. It is therefore my recommendation that TDT reject this application.

This is an application to establish a VTC in Mirui ward and involves building 3 classrooms, a workshop, 2 offices and a store.  Godfrey has visited the site of the VTC and met applicants, ward and village leaders and young people and their parents.  He has also spoken to the DEO who is very supportive.  The District Council will pay for teachers for the VTC, which will be registered with VETA. Godfrey recommends that TDT approves this application. What follows is based closely on Godfrey's report. He believes the VTC leaders are honest and committed. They have experience of village and ward leadership. Godfrey met groups of boys and girls separately and found enthusiasm for tailoring, masonry, carpentry, electricity and vehicle mechanics courses. Godfrey's findings confirmed the community consultation findings of the group. Courses will meet VETA standards.  There is no VTC or other training organisation within reasonable travelling distance of the 4 villages which make up Mirui ward. The 10 acres' site for the VTC has been given to the group by the village. A 'customary land lease' is being negotiated which 'is legally accepted under the Tanzania Land Act'. The VTC will need solar power as TANESCO has not yet reached the village.  Water supply is good. The group will contribute 7 million shillings through members' contributions, chicken business and sale of crops.  An annual fee of 150,000 shillings will be charged to the students.  Godfrey found parents willing to accept this. He commented 'I think the budget is realistic and the money they have asked for is not too much'.  It was prepared by the District Engineer so will be 'full price' rather than the sort of budget Innocent Temu in Manyoni achieved for the girls' hostel by using local fundis and buying all the materials himself. However this is a complex project and needs professional supervision. Plans and the budget are on the database. The costs are similar to those we have funded in Marumba for classrooms and toilets.  The group has offered to contribute £2400 towards the total cost, through members' contributions, sale of chickens and crops. They will also build toilets and a kitchen.  This VTC has the potential to transform the life chances of more than 100 young people each year in these 4 remote villages in one of Tanzania's poorest districts.

The group also wants to train girls in tailoring. They have a small space available for this near their offices and already have two machines. Kevin is unsure of their training capacity although the group's leaders assured him that they have volunteer teachers. Kevin would support funding them to buy 10 sewing machines and one sweater/knitting machine. Kevin was contacted twice in July 2018 by group members wanting information about their bid. He has asked Janet to respond.  In Sept 2018 Kevin became the PO relating Janet. I have now written to the group asking for an update as it is 2 years since they first applied. Contract sent on 28 November 2018.","This is an application for sewing equipment and for the expansion of a chicken rearing project. Kevin visited the project on Janet's behalf in January 2018 together with the Kigoma Community Development Officer (CDO). Since then Evelyn Leonard, our local rep, has sent a member of Hope of the Community to visit. The application for chicken rearing is not supported on the advice of the CDO who pointed out that many chickens had already died because of poor management. However, he recommends support for the sewing project as does Evelyn. This would train young women, primary school leavers, giving them a skill that they can use to generate small incomes. The young women will come from both Kigoma and nearby villages. The group has volunteer trainers and has answered questions about initial supply of materials, marketing of products and future sustainability to the CDO's satisfaction. Premises are already available to the group for the sewing training course. The training course will not be accredited and the group is too small to gain VETA recognition. Kevin felt that the group was well organised, well chaired and enthusiastic when he met them. His only doubt is about the ability of the group to train the young women with volunteer trainers, but the CDO and Evelyn have said this is possible. A grant of £1,724 is recommended for the purchase of 10 sewing machines and a knitting machine.

There is strong support from the District Council and the District Commissioner promised to fund desks at a recent public meeting. Julian, Ann and Kevin will meet him in Marumba on 22 January 2017 at a public gathering to celebrate all the recent development work.
We have already funded the construction of one classroom. There remains a severe lack of classroom space.  Classrooms are very overcrowded and many children are taught in the open air.  What is more, all the the toilets are dilapidated and beyond repair.  There is no water supply at the school so hand washing is impossible.  The nearest water source is 2k away.

A community contribution of 'forest products', sand, stones and labour worth £3,314 has been reported by Linus.  He describes this as a remarkable example of community support.

The total cost of 2 classrooms, 8 toilets and 2 water tanks is £13,100 (using 2645 shillings = one pound).  TDT's 40% contribution would be £5,240, with Eucanaid paying £7,860. I recommend we award a grant of £5,240 subject to Eucanaid agreeing to fund the balance. If funds are insufficient we could delay one classroom until 2017 but approve it in principle at this meeting.  This would reduce the total cost to £9,418 and TDT's 40% contribution to £3,767.

This happens regularly during the dry season, and they can not rely on water from the main hospital tanks.
Having discussed the application and how the water tank would be built and maintained , it was decided that the initial idea was impractical and unlikely to remain serviceable long term. They resubmitted a new plan to use 6 x 5000 litre plastic SIM tanks instead. 
This is a well established and supported Anglican Mission hospital that is not eligible for Govt. funding. 
They have a large new dormitory building, almost completed, but with no water facilities or funding to install.
The number of SIM tanks requested is 6, but this project could easily be scaled down according to available funds, and the committee's thoughts.  They said 'even 2 tanks would be better than nothing'.  
Mvumi Hospital is intending, with the new dorm block, to double its student intake next year.  Student fees will enable them to budget for more tanks next year.
I would like to recommend TDT fund a minimum of 3 tanks to assist them during this interim period.  This is a worthwhile project and feel it would be completed and administered with the best use of funds.

Project Objectives: 

To enhance the reading skills of primary school children of Lindi (Tanzania) and let them experience that reading can be fun.   Children in Tanzania are taught in the Kiswahili language; English is taught from Standard 4. To enhance the reading culture of the primary schools, teaching staff of 10 primary schools in the Lindi district were introduced to methods to familiarize these children with reading. In addition, a large number of books was brought in from The Netherlands for distribution to the 10 primary schools.  The TDT small grant enabled the production of 10 book boxes.


Project outcome: 
In the 10 participating schools in the Lindi Municipal district there are approximately 350 children per school in standard 4, 5, 6 and 7 per school. This will give more than 3500 children a chance to read English fiction books in English at their own reading level. By half yearly bi-annual (June and December) changing the collection of children’s reading books, children have at least 4 years of reading pleasure. Looking at the aimed project time of four years thus 14.000 children can profit, enjoy reading and profit from increasing their level in English levels.
A district representative will rotate the books among the participating schools twice a year such that the collections of all ten schools form a reading carousel for all. This will enable all children to read a large variety of children’s books.




",13,"Provision of 30 book boxes for reading carousel project for storage and movement of books for children in Lindi.  The books are donated by the Dutch brand of an international organization: Read to Grow. This will be about 4500 - 5000 used books.  Value of the transport is around $ 250. The transport will be done by Mission and Relief.  The local committee and the staff of the local library will help to distribute the books on a number of (30) read boxes (large boxes of about 0.25 m2 - 150 books per box) and distribute them on the (10) participating schools. These boxes are made by a local carpenter. In every school is one of the teachers responsible for the issuance and collection of books. Every week there is a changeover time when children can return a book and can choose a new book. The teacher keeps a simple registration and is responsible for the condition of the books. Four times a year the collection changes. A district representative exchanges the collection to another school, and so all ten boxes constitute a reading carousel: a good opportunity for children to read a lot of children’s books. We ask the Tanzania Development Trust to support our plan in providing the money to make and buy 30 big sustainable wooden boxes. (250 dm³ per box) Prices will be around  45.000 Tsh / 20 dollar  per box. Together with the cost of the locks the requested amount of money will be 1.350.000 Tsh.

The odds are stacked against them.  Even opening a bank account and getting a support letter from the District Council involved four expensive trips to town over a period of 4 months. They had not seen the Kiswahili version of the application form so completing the form in English involved paying a secondary school leaver.  The resulting form is a dog's dinner but it's an authentic expression of what they want to achieve. I went through every section with them at a group meeting. The group has 8 members and total beneficiaries of 30. The village is 12m from Kigoma town. I saw the land they want to clear, close to a river that flows year round and will provide water for their vegetable farm. They have thought through the use of the land for vegetable growing, secure storage of the equipment, maintenance of the water pump and marketing of the vegetables.  The equipment they want to buy will enable them to irrigate their new land, grow vegetables and increase their incomes. I recommend a grant of £1119 (2,908,000 shillings). The per beneficiary cost of the grant is £36. Perhaps we should use this measure of cost effectiveness for similar applications. Committee agreed a grant of £900.  Before this is paid Kevin will ask Benedicto to visit the group and advise about Alex's Seedchange group.  Alex has said he can advise about irrigation schemes.  The committee is concerned about maintaining a water pump bought from so far away as Mwanza.  Some members thought a foot operated treddle pump would be more sustainable.  PG pointed out that the group numbered only 8 members but they had applied for 10 of some items.  This led to Kevin suggesting a reduced grant of £900 which was agreed. Later- in June Benedicto visited the group.  He has now advised that they use the grant to purchase a diesel pump for irrigation as the area is too large to be serviced by a treadle pump.  He says that there are spares available in Kigoma and the group knows the source.

I've asked Innocent Temu to check the cost of cows and bulls.  1,800,000 and 1,600,000 respectively look high to me as does the cost of transporting 3 animals at 1,800,000 (£666). In May 2018 Kevin write to Flora Hindi (copied to new rep Willard Titus) asking for a progress report. In June Willard told me that Flora had told him that the cows are pregnant now.  December 2019: Wilhard told Kevin that the project was a success.  The group now has calves.","Priority 1 recommendation

I met 10 members of the Amkeni women's group in Muhala village on 16 February 2017.  The members are well organised, enthusiastic and have business experience.  Total beneficiaries including immediate family members will be 70 so that the unit cost of this project per beneficiary would be £34.  The village is short drive from Manyoni town. Unusually for Manyoni district it has a good year round water supply.
The group has 20 goats, kept in a large banda, and 2 sewing machines. They want to expand by buying 2 cows and a bull and building a banda to keep them in.  They will collect grass and water to feed them.  They say there is a good supply of both year round. They will keep female calves, building up a small herd, and sell male calves.  Milk will be sold in the village and in Manyoni.  There is a large unmet demand for milk.  Each cow will produce 20 litres of milk each day.
Good advice and veterinary inputs are available in the village from the Ward Livestock Officer. Some members of the group have previous experience of keeping cows. I raised several issues with Flora Hindi, the head of community development at Manyoni Council who discussed these with the group.  A revised, lower budget was submitted, reducing the cost of the banda and removing the bull, as a bull can be 'borrowed' locally (this budget has not yet been uploaded for technical reasons). Despite my probings, Flora and the group insist that they want to source the cows from Arusha.  They also insist that each cow can produce 20 litres of milk each day for about 26 weeks.  They are being advised by Rehema Mnyampala, the Ward Livestock Officer who has 7 years' work experience. Milk can be sold for 1,000 shillings per litre.  The group proposes to sell 75% of their milk and use the remainder for family consumption. Phil Grant has suggested that funds for the purchase of livestock be held back until the banda has been constructed.  I agree.  I therefore recommend a total grant of £2401, with £687 awarded now for band construction and £1714 held back.  I will continue to discuss with Flora and Rehema cheaper and nearer sources of cows. Later Flora advised me that District Livestock Officer had advised that Fresian cows could be bought in Dodoma or Singida for 1,500,000 plus 200,000 transport cost each. He insists that Fresian cows can produce 20 litres per day.  The budget has been revised downwards.  I am now recommending a grant of £1872.  £687 to be awarded for building the banda and £1185 held back for the cows.

The water is filthy. Livestock enter the water to drink and villagers wash their clothes at the edge of the pond. Students told me that they drink the water without boiling as there is no fuel available for making a fire. As a consequence they experience stomach problems. In the wet season water is sometimes available from a village well only 500 metres away but this is shared with 1,500 villagers and depends on a diesel pump which can be out of service for several weeks at a time. When this happens water has to be carried from a well 5k away. Again this water is only available in the wet season. No teachers' houses have been equipped with water storage tanks.

William has expressed strong support for the group.The group has requested support to establish a microcredit scheme, pig keeping and poultry farming. They have experience of running a microcredit scheme and 4 members have received training from Wabia. The current scheme has 48 women members.  9.6 million shillings are loaned out, with a maximum loan of 200,000. I recommend that we award 3m shillings (£1071) which is the amount they requested so that they can expand the microcredit scheme.

Water borne diseases including cholera are common.  Innocent recommends support. However, we will await implementation of the boreholes project by Benedicto Hosea in Masigati (591) because 3 boreholes could be provided for less cost than one storage tank. This would also address the villagers' needs. Innocent explained that some students walk 10k each way to school. There is a partly completed hostel for 80 students.  There are also 6 teachers' houses awaiting completion. One library/classroom has solar light for evening study by students who stay near the school.  Innocent commended the efforts of the Head Teacher who is hard working. Many trees and flowers have been planted at the school.  There are no trees in the surrounding area. Innocent is keen to support and encourage the leaders of this rural school. Kevin will visit in February 2017.  Kevin will recommend support but await the implementation of the Masigati water project before deciding what level of funding to suggest. Benedicto also needs to visit Kinangali school and village to assess the potential for low cost boreholes. We may have this so the project has been changed to 03.  If no information from Masigati is available by the time of the November 2017 committee the project will revert to 02. Based on figures supplied by Benedicto £3220 would fund 3 boreholes with manual pumps in Kinangali. If this amount is unaffordable at the November 2017 committee meeting, £2400 would enable 2 boreholes to be provided. I have discussed the figures with Benedicto. They include a small 'profit' for his group Mboni ya Vijana. This is sensible now that he and the group are travelling to other regions to share their low cost borehole technology. They have already visited Masigati in Singida at TDT's request and have agreed to go to Heru Ushingu in Kigoma so some modest reward seems acceptable to me.

Maternal Child Health Advisor with the Regional Health Management Team (RHMT): focus on revised Maternal and Perinatal Death Review process for data collection and analysis with the goal that reviews are timely and data analysis can inform program and policy planning at the facility, district and regional level to reduce maternal and perinatal deaths.  Started Oct 2016; finish October 2017.

Supporting RHMT, particularly the Regional Reproductive Child Health Coordinator and her assistant, to implement a sustainable process for data collection and analysis of Maternal and Perinatal Death data to inform policy and program planning.

In order to develop a sustainable process for collation and analysis of Maternal and Perinatal Death Review data to inform policy and program planning in a timely fashion, a dedicated computer is required.  At present, personal computers are being used and no computer is available for use by the assistant.  I want to support the Regional Reproductive Child Health Coordinator and her assistant to implement this system using open access software and Microsoft Office at the regional level.  Once we have accomplished that, we can begin to teach the data entry process at the District and facility level.  Eventually data will only need to be entered once at the facility level with the consequence of improving the quality of the information collected.  We anticipate using an open access data entry and analysis program such as EPI INFO. A dedicated laptop will also allow me to help the Regional Reproductive Child Health Coordinator and her assistant to increase their capacity to analyse and report findings as a basis for planning policy and programs.  

I am requesting funds to purchase a laptop computer and Microsoft Office to address this gap in resources.  I  plan to purchase a new 15 inch HP 250 G4 Notebook PC, i3-5005 CPU, 2GHz, 4 GB RAM, 500GB Hard Drive with Windows 7 Professional and Office Suite installed with 1 year warranty.  The attached quote is for 1, 150,000 TZ Shillings and is considered to be very competitive locally.  
Although a lower starting price may be available in Dar Es Salaam, I, in consultation with the Regional Medical Officer of Health, considered the cost of transport and the accessibility of service and conclude that this is the better option.

","The need for solar power in the primary school was discussed by Marumba village leaders with Kevin and Julian in January 2017. The proposal is to provide lights in the 8 classrooms, staff room and head's room and 8 toilets. This will enable students to return to school after dark to study and to be coached for national exams.  The school is located centrally in Marumba so the children can walk to it safely after dark.  What's more the school rooms will be a resource for other village activities and meetings after dark.  Teachers will be able to charge phones - a small perk in this tough posting. 8 toilets with lights and water tanks are likely to be heavily used.  Linus' budget is a little over egged as usual.  It's clear that he has does not have time to seek competitive quotes.  I therefore recommend a grant of £1200, being 40% of £3000.  The balance of £1800 (60% of the total) will be funded by Eucanaid.

Lack of a secure livelihood source for the marginalized women of Wagogo tribe in Dodoma has been all along caused by high levels of irriteracy.

It is a rural day school 21k from Muleba town. They have requested funding in order to complete a house in the school grounds and use it as a hostel for about 30 Form 4 girls. Kevin met the girls and learnt that many walk more than 20k each day to and from school.  The 2018 national examination results showed that many girls failed completely. No girl got Division 1 or 2 which is necessary to go on to Form 5 in a government school.  A hostel will help to improve girls’ performance and give them a more satisfying experience in what for many will be their last year at school.  However, I fear that most girls will continue to get a very low pass or fail in Form 4 exams. This is because Ikondo School has been unable to employ any teacher of Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry or Physics since Magufuli outlawed parental contributions. The President’s policy has led directly to large scale failure in Form 4 examinations.  Some teachers talk of a conspiracy by the elite to ensure that poor children are socially excluded. Certainly the impact of the policy has been to make social mobility through egalitarian education a thing of the past.  I asked the form 4 students to tell me about the challenges the school faces and then to vote for the most serious challenge that needed addressing. A large majority of students voted  ‘the lack of science and maths teachers resulting from the ban on parental contributions’ to be the most serious challenge they faced. So whilst I recommend support for this project in the sum of £3000 I think we must accept that it will not lead to more girls progressing to Form 5.  That may be sufficient reason not to fund it.  Do we say anything to the government about the impact of the ‘no contributions’ policy? . 

Janet: My understanding is that their belief is that having a teachers house will help with recruitment, which makes sense.

In the past they have operated by renovating a room in a poorly resourced school to create a library for which we have provided the cost of some of the books.
On this occasion, they are applying to us for a more holistic  project  called "Open Mind Learning", which augments their normal approach with a number of measures to improve both student learning and teaching methodologies.
The school where they want our help is Kingani Secondary School, a mixed day school about 7km from Bagamoyo. The area is essentially a poor one, with low levels of literacy and education, and the school currently achieves poor results, thus READ's desire to develop a holistic literacy project.
Although we have funded READ a fair bit in the past, I would like to recommend that we provide some more funding this time, partly because the school and area is very needy but also because I feel that READ's more developed approach has a better chance of producing lasting change.

Kevin visited this project in January 2018 on Janet’s behalf. Buyaga is a village 21k from Muleba town and 2k from Ikondo Secondary School where our representative Alpha Ngailla teaches.  He found a large women’s group which has taken charge of a 6 acres plot near a small river. The group is well led by mwenyekiti Theodosia Laurent (0764375772) and advised by Aniceth Niwemugizi (0746173435) a retired local government officer. They have clear plans to farm vegetables. They need a solar pump to bring water from the river.  Kevin discussed this with Janet and with Simusolar in Mwnza who recommend Pampu Mavuno. This has 460w and can pump 2300 litres per hour after a 20m incline. Total cost of the pump including pipes and a day’s training on site from an agronomist is 5,700,000 (£1965 using 2900 to 1gbp). The training cost is £152. The pump comes with a two years’ warranty. The use of a solar pump in this village will attract a lot of attention and hopefully make farmers aware of the potential of this low cost sustainable technology. They also need to hire a tractor for 2 days to plough the large shamba ( £83) and a further £344 for initial purchase of seeds. I recommend a grant therefore of £2392.

He talks enthusiastically about 'changing the mindset of the youth towards creativity and innovation'.

Nobody in the group had received training elsewhere and nobody had any other source of regular income. The three products launched so far are honey, biscuits and pumpkin seed powder (see photo on db). They have been packaged attractively and the high prices make sense in the growing middle-class market of Dodoma. The young members sell them door to door and sales are going well.

The original pipework  installations  to the villages are in surprisingly good condition due to a previous very good local district water department installation scheme. 
The application from the Village Executive Officer is for a more substantial repair to the dam and pipe catchment which saves and distributes the water to the 9 villages, including the clinic. 
Due to the supply failure the villages and clinic are having to use very dirty and unhealthy river water with resultant increase in disease and poor nutrition. 
The project has very positive local oversight and planning from the District water engineer department, the Development Officer and village community leaders. The overall quotation for repairing the small dam and subsequent catchment pipe distribution system is £4750 and it may be useful to add a small contingency of around £350. 
The local district community  contribution in addition is £1,080 for transport and labour which is an indication of the commitment locally to this project. 

Kevin says that the water situation here is currently dire and the  dam and catchment pipe service repairs will restore all 9 villages and clinic to a much needed healthy supply.

I encouraged the application because his organisation has already done work in schools encouraging students and teachers to plant fruit trees. His proposal now is to plant 4,000 fruit trees in 6 schools. 660 trees would be given to each school. The species would be orange, mango, pawpaw, passion and guava. Fruit would be given to children and teachers - it would not be sold. Costs include the seedlings, transport to schools, 'maintenance costs' such as tree fencing, disease control and project monitoring and evaluation. This is a well presented application from a man with lots of successful experience of applying to international donors.  What makes me uneasy is the way in which Steven readily reduces or eliminates budgets when questioned about them. For example, when I said that I thought 500,000 per month for 12 months for monitoring and evaluation was expensive he immediately reduced this to 300,000.  And when I challenged the monthly consultancy fee of 400,000 for 12 months, suggesting that District Council and 'buana miti' services could be used he simply eliminated the total 4,800,000 from the budget. So, I have my doubts about his bona fides.  The total request is now for £4,827, reduced from the original £6,034 (using £1 = 2,900 shillings). We could shave some of the maintenance and monitoring costs and offer a grant of say £4,000. However, my only recommendation is that members look at the application and consider my report. This indicates the uncertainty I have about the applicant and not the merits of encouraging school students and teachers to plant fruit trees. I should also say I came straight to this project from assessing the Kinyika village water supply application (654, also on this agenda) and would not want to see an application of this sort using scarce funds which could instead be applied to meeting an urgent need for clean water.

He is clearly a highly respected and hard working village leader.  Several years ago he received TDT funding for solar power at the clinic in Lubalisi. An issue arose because he used some of the funding to rent an office for Inua Jamii in Kigoma without TDT's consent. He was challenged and repaid some of the money. This application is for furniture for the nursery classroom in Nkonkwa, a water storage tank and microscope for the clinic in Nkonkwa, a well and solar power for the primary school in Vilongwa. The nursery class is huge - more than 70 children - with one teacher. It is not providing a worthwhile experience for the children and I recommend that we reject the request for furniture. I was unconvinced by the suggested arrangement for using the microscope in the clinic. Asheri told me that the clinic staff did not have the skills to use it but that village volunteers - former health staff - would be able to interpret blood slides. I recommend that we reject this request. However, the need for the water storage tank (10,000 litres) is very clear and I recommend a grant of £1,640. Vilongwa primary school (513 students, 62 in standard 7) is well led by Peter Malongwa. He has improved the school results and it is now fifth in the Ivinza district league table. A remarkable achievement for a remote village school. He has also established a large school shamba and is using the proceeds to provide the children with uji every day. A school well will mean that students no longer consume dirty lake water and don't waste time carrying water for long distances. The Head also wants to install lights in one classroom so that children in standard 7 can return in the evenings to study before their national exams. They all live nearby so he does not see walking to school after dark as a problem. I recommend grants of £1,362 for the well and £864 for solar power.

Also agreed to return application to 02 so that Kevin and Benedicto can assess in January 2019. I took the view that no contract was required for the £600 approved on 16 May 2018 as this was a repeat grant to the same group for the same purpose. It is the fourth grant of £600 made to ANCO for finding homes for street children. The £600 was paid to ANCO in June 2018.  The application for a child care centre is complex and cannot be assessed without a visit. 

We know ANCO well now, having awarded them three small grants of £600 each over the last three years to rehabilitate 15 boys and girls living in the streets of Kasulu.  Their Director, Obadiah Benguye, has reported thoroughly on their use of the grants to get some children off he streets and into school or petty trading. This is an ambitious proposal to establish a day centre for street children in Kasulu, offering vocational training in cooperation with the staff of two local colleges, literacy and numeracy training, counselling and four 'emergency' beds. I think it needs a more thorough assessment than is possible from a UK desk. I need to consult the Social Welfare Department of the Halmashauri, the DEO and the Colleges. I want to meet the ANCO Board to establish how strong it is for such a big project. I also want to meet the CCM who are landlord of the proposed centre. I would like to consult the street children (some are older teens) to find out how interested they are in the vocational training to be offered. There is also the possibility of cooperation with Railway Children, an international organisation working with street children in six Tanzanian cities, though not Kasulu. Our representative Benedicto has many questions about the proposal which need discussing with the ANCO Board. I propose therefore to return the application to O2 until I have visited in January 2019. In the meantimeI recommend a further grant of £600 to enable ANCO to continue rehabilitating small numbers of street children - potentially six with this grant. In October 2018 I received a report from Obadiah on the use of the £600 grant. This is on the database. It includes mention of 5 children returned home from the streets of Kasulu. This small project is now therefore completed. However, I cannot change the status code as this refers to the large application for a centre which I will assess in January 2019 when I visit Kasulu. On 21 November 2018 a small grant of £2113 was approved for a pilot literacy project for 9 months. Kevin sent the contract on 28 November 2018. Because this project number refers to a bigger application which Kevin will assess in January 2019 it remains at 02.","We have supported ANCO with 3 small grants so that they can find homes for boys and girls sleeping rough on Kasulu's streets. They have had some remarkable successes - and some failures where children have returned to the street - and have reported well on their achievements ( see database).  Their main application for a child rehabilitation centre remains at 02, pending my visit in January 2019. It is a complex proposal requiring discussion with district authorities and others. In the meantime ANCO wish to establish a literacy and numeracy class for 12 of the street children (aged mostly 12 to 17) who are illiterate.  The first step to escaping absolute poverty is to achieve basic literacy. I have discussed this with the ANCO Director Obadiah, whom I know well, and have agreed to ask the committee to provide a small grant for a pilot scheme. It is 'pilot' in that ANCO are wanting to tackle this problem in a new way and for only 12 of the 30 plus illiterate children initially. Some of these children have been rejected by primary schools because of misconduct. Others have tried the special primary school for older students and have left because they have been beaten often for minor misdemeanours.  Some of these young people have significant anger management issues and are unwilling to tolerate the beating regime of the schools.  ANCO propose to employ a literacy and numeracy teacher for 3 hours each day for 5 days each week for 9 months initially. ANCO has the support of the District Education Officer, whom I have met. The teacher has been identified and has agreed with Obadiah that he will not beat the children. I have agreed with Obadiah that if there is any departure from this agreement the teacher will be dismissed. I will check progress in January 2019 an ask the young people what they think about the classes. A grant is sought to pay the teacher (250,000 each month), pay for a breakfast every morning for the children (some of whom will have slept in the street), rent a room, purchase desks, books and educational materials. I recommend a grant of £2,113 so that ANCO can help this very deprived group of youngsters.
We have supported ANCO in Kasulu for several years with small grants. They used these to return boys from the streets of Kasulu to their homes or most recently to set up numeracy and literacy classes for street children. The current application is much more ambitious. ANCO is requesting a large grant to open a training centre with emergency beds for street children. I visited ANCO in January and discussed it with Mwakilishi Benedicto. Despite the worthy objective of giving street children vocational skills, we agree that ANCO does not have the capacity to run a project of this size. I recommend rejection.

This involved meeting heads,  setting up nutrition groups, planting of the seeds and fruits and sacks with the aims 	"Students will produce enough vegetables and fruits to meet their requirement	When production is high, school will be able to  sell vegetables and fruits and generate income.	Students will replicate this knowledge to their homes after school.  This will not only increase homestead food production but also household micro incomes.

NYDT undertook a pilot at a school 15 km from Bitale and attached a report, and want to replicate it now in 4 other schools: They’re aim is for each student to manage one sack which can produce 45 chinese leaf? Plants.
The issues are: 1; How sustainable is the project. The pilot reports success with pictures and that vegetables have been sold to provide income for the school. But it has much information missing eg: how many plants produced, how many students, how much money was made from selling veg by who, accountability, and what was it used for, evidence of any food production at home, no fruits etc  Monitoring was after  2 months so does not have evidence to see if it continues after even 1 or 2 cycles of planting.
 I have sent a very long list of questions which may be too much (see latest documents) but may have a response before the meeting as NYDT know the date of the meeting.
2; The costs are divided into 9 activities Only one is for materials; The others are for training and monitoring and include transport costs for staff and facilitators, facilitation fees, meals and high stationary costs. Lastly, the project is quite top down with the arrival of NYTD into the school.
The organisation is well organised has a good website, has obtained funding from other sources, has some good elements, is known by Kevin and Evelyn visited and recommended funding.

The second part of the application is for staff toilets (a small block containing 1 female and one male toilet) as teachers currently have to use a toilet in an unfinished staff house several hundred metres from the school. This is second priority, but I still believe important for staff moral and attendance. Budgeted cost is Tsh5.5 million

This includes the grant of £3039 awarded in 2018 and sent already. I will not ask Robert to send the £2600 until Wilhard has confirmed that the village has the 8 million we sent last year in its account together with a further 8 million from korosho sales which they told us about when we visited.

Copy in documents and SC changed by JP","I visited Kinyika in February 2018 at the request of our representative Innocent Temu who was aware of the dire water situation facing the village.  I was greeted enthusiastically by 20 village leaders and village council members.  It was a hard journey from Manyoni town in the rains. The car provided by the District Council was abandoned in deep mud and we walked the last 6k to the village. Kinyika forms part of Mkwese ward. There are 310 families and 1,560 people in all. All farmers, they grow cotton, cashew nuts, tobacco and keep a few cows.  There is no water source in Kinyika other than a small river and a pond during the wet season. Both dry up in the dry season. One old man has a private well on his land and confirmed that he had found water at 20 feet. The well had been dug by hand. The District Water Engineer has advised that a village well can be dug by hand and that the water table is at about 20 feet. This will give the village a year round supply of water.  There is no salt in the water. Villagers have offered to supply sand, stones and rocks for the construction and to help the fundi with free labour.  During our two hour meeting we discussed many needs in the village.  Every one present agreed that the lack of clean drinking water is the greatest need facing the people of Kinyika. The budget is £3,039 (using £1 = 2,900 shillings). This includes provision for a 10,000 litres tank and a pump. I recommend a grant of £3,039 plus an additional amount advised by Janet for chlorination.  Willard our new Manyoni representative will advise the village leaders on the chlorination process, drawing on advice from the District Water Engineer, and on the establishment of a committee to collect small amounts of money from each household for the future maintenance of both the well and the chlorination system. This separate amount will be held back until Willard confirms that arrangements are in hand. These will depend upon the availability of competent  technicians and the approval of the District and village authorities as there is no familiarity with water treatment in villages. For about £2 per person we can help the villagers of Kinyika to solve their water crisis.
Kevin visited Kinyika again in January 2019 and met village leaders together with TDT representative Wilhard. He also discussed ithe water problem with the Director of Manyoni District. 

We sent £2600 to Kinyika village in 2018. This was in response to their request to dig a borehole. Later, village leaders decided not to dig a borehole but instead to seek funding to link the village by pipes to a large water source in Mkwese village, 6k away. Their reasons are sound. A borehole will not provide a reliable source of water in all seasons.  The quantity of water will be insufficient to serve 4,200 people. The water will be untreated. By contrast the water from Mkwese will be reliable because the large generator/pump will be connected to TANESCO, there is an unlimited supply of water and it’s treated. 

The cost of bringing water to Kinyika by pipes and constructing a tank is 25m. We have already sent 8m. The village has sold its korosho harvest and has 8m to contribute. The DED has agreed to provide 1 million. I recommend that TDT provides a further grant of £2600 (8 million). 

People are walking or cycling 12k to and from Mkwese to collect water. It takes 3 hours - more in wet weather when paths turn to deep mud in places. The Kinyika village leadership is energetic. They have registered a new primary school with 420 pupils and have started to construct a secondary school. I hope members agree to support them. This project is recommended by Wilhard.

They live very humbly indeed and small additional incomes from the sale of vegetables will make a real difference to their lives. Two of the group - Said and Skolastika - have previous experience of growing vegetables. Said has been trained in budgeting and cash flow preparations. They have rented 4 hectares of land in Burega (aka Bulega) village, 4k from Kigoma. The land is very close to the lake. It is bush but will be relatively easy to clear as it contains no trees. They will dig a water hole and line it and fetch water from the lake. They will grow vegetables and have named tomatoes, peppers, cabbage and spinach in their application.  They will fence the land with local materials to prevent goats from eating the crops. They will build a small banda and take it in turns to stay at the farm during the growing season to prevent theft. The diesil pump used for irrigation and the tools will be kept for security at the Chair’s house. They have thought carefully about marketing and selling their vegetables. There is a growing market in Kigoma. I challenged their request for 10 sets of tools and they have agreed that it is unlikely that all 10 members of the group will be able to work on the land at the same time.  Accordingly they reduced their request to 6 sets. They have offered a contribution from group members of 690,000 to fund diesil for the pump and transport of inputs to the site.

I suspect we will be told that Marumba clinic now serves a much bigger community than Marumba village because of the good quality facilities. Both the maternity unit and the primary school staff toilet are supported by Eucanaid.  The total cost of the maternity unit is £6,900 so the TDT share (40%) would be £2,760.

16th October.  Hello Mr Jonathan, 
I would like to share with you my report on the visit at ijumbi ward( Muleba district) where the project is,

Officially the project started 2017, where the village community gave KAWESO plot of land, approximately 3 Hectors. In the the same year they received found from US Embassy TZ, PEPFAR, the found received was used to buy machine.

The Project aim to do the following,
1. Help people living with HIV, by giving them employment once the project starts, particularly youth and widows in ijumbi ward.

2. Build affordable houses for marginalised families 
3.Also the project is said to benefit the community at large hence they will be access bricks in a cheap price.

I also wanted to know why they decided to establish such project at ijumbi ward though there are many wards facing similar challenges,

     Ijumbi ward has a large number of people living with HIV comparing to other wards, in Muleba district. This is according to 3 years national reports.
               My recommendations 
1. The start of the project will play a vital role to solve the day to day challenges that people living with HIV do face, but if there will be good management of the project that will ensure the sustainability of the project
2. The project will rise the living standard of the people.( marginalised ones)
  Thank you very much.
Ngailla Alpha.

Grant paid and bank receipt received  JP  16/06/2019
","The initial application (£2,678) for this brick making project at Ijumbi Ward in Muleba District was made by KAWESO NGO. We have previously funded Water Points and Village Latrines successfully with the organisation. The project started 2017, when the village community gave KAWESO plot of land, approximately 3 Hectors. In the the same year they received funds from US Embassy TZ, PEPFAR, to buy a brick making machine. The application was to purchase cement and sand materials with associated transport costs to enable a youth group to make bricks to sell locally. Additionally a grant was requested to purchase a solar pump and pipes to move water to the brick making site. Aims of the project are: 1. Help people living with HIV, by giving them employment once the project starts, particularly youth and widows in Ijumbi ward. This ward has a large number of people living with HIV compared with other wards, in Muleba district. This is according to 3 years national reports. ( Alpha Ngailla. LR) 2. Build affordable houses for marginalised families and sell bricks locally for income. The budget submitted was however uncertain in terms of costs related to possible income and profit with a large amount for longer term administration. Following a review on line with the NGO Director Bertha Andrew, who has met  Kevin and Janet and a visit by Local Rep Alpha Ngailla, it has been agreed that the initial project start up should be a reduced costs option and the solar pump has been put on hold until the group show that they can produce more limited but realistic brick production using more limited sand and cement materials and local labour. Dan also looked over their budget proposals and agreed with me that it was somewhat inflated and needed trimming.  Should the group show that they can meet the revised budget and production targets we may receive a further request for funding from KAWESO to increase production and possibly consider supporting the water pump and pipes.
I recommend a reduced grant of £1,600 (Tzshs 4,835,000)

We met teachers, the school board members and the students. 1,400 children are served by 6 filthy, semi-derelict toilets. The worst I have ever seen.  There is no water in the school and the Chair of the School Board said it is impossible to ask children to bring water from home, so dire is the water situation. I saw maize crops dead and shrivelled in fields near the school. This request is for funding for 12 toilets for girls and 8 toilets for boys. It comes from an NGO called Peace and Conservation which works closely with the school. The budget is very big and I have asked Salumu to meet the Mkuu to see if costs can be reduced. I've also asked him to explore implementation directly through the school and not through Peace and Conservation.  On 21 February 2019 Salumu said he had arranged to meet the Mkuu.  Salumu sent me a new budget for 17,124,330 (£5,904). This is a little higher than the original because at my suggestion they have added two 10,000 litres water storage tanks, sited at the toilets. This new budget has been prepared without the involvement of the Peace NGO.  The project will now be implemented directly by the school, at my suggestion. If members are inclined to support primary school toilets (do we need to debate that?) there is no doubt that this school's needs are very great. I recommend a grant of £5,904.

The report is uploaded but not the receipts. The clinic now has a roof. However, it is a long way from opening. Salumu has submitted a budget - but not an application - showing that they need a further 50 million, including 20 million for joinery alone. This is unachievable from any sources in my view.  Fearing another Matongo situation I have asked Ezekiel to investigate. He recommended the project earlier this year. My request is that Ezekiel discusses with Salumu a more modest scheme which would give the village a small health facility - perhaps two rooms with a third room as a nurse's home. Salumu is honest and motivated but over ambitious. Ezekiel has agreed to go soon. I will visit in March 2020.","I visited Sanga village in February 2019 with Salumu from FODEO ( based in Nyashimo)after first meeting his Chair Dr Ndegi in the busy and well organised FODEO office in Nyashimo. I received an astonishing reception from 700 village leaders and villagers. Lots of music and dancing before speech making inside the walls of the clinic.  The clinic has been built up to lintel level. The need is very clear as the nearest health facility is 15k away. As I mingled with villagers they told me about people who had died - especially women in child birth - because they could not get access to any health care. Money is requested for roofing, flooring and woodwork mostly. The DED has promised funding for a borehole. TANESCO supply is very close.  I explained that we would need to see a doctor's house before we could consider funding. It's a good project, with enthusiastic leadership and I'm confident they will bring it to fruition. Salumu is an outstanding leader, with potential to be a TDT Mwakilishi.  In Ezekiel's absence he accompanied me on two other project visits and was very insightful. I'm now waiting for evidence that the doctor's house is being constructed. Later note on 26 April 2019: today Salumu sent me photos of the work done so far on the doctor's house.  Salumu is remarkably effective - a driven man. In February when I asked about water supply for the clinic he got a commitment to fund a borehole from the Busega DED within 2 days. When I told him that TDT could not support a clinic without a doctor's house he went to the village leadership and within 6 weeks villagers' contributions had been mobilised, hundreds of bricks made and the doctor's house built to window sill level.  I have confidence in him and FODEO.  There is no risk here of a Matongo clinic repeat. However, I am putting my enthusiasm to the test by asking Ezekiel to visit. He cannot report with his assessment until after the deadline for papers for the May meeting so I will inform members of his views verbally.  Subject to Ezekiel's advice I recommend a grant of £5,000. Later note on 9 May 2019: Ezekiel has visited Sanga and strongly recommends support for the project.

The stations provide clean drinking water for the surrounding villagers and pastoralists while allowing safe washing and animal grazing downstream – it really is a simple and cost-effective solution. 
I also visited one of the proposed sites for this application, a natural spring where local villagers and pastoralists currently collect drinking water. It was self-evident by the colour and nature of the water that this natural spring was likely to be contaminated. This single source provides drinking water for approximately 4000 people.

Citizens will contribute to the sand and labor (labor) and the donor will contribute to the cost of building materials and transportation.
All sources will be managed by the Bisheke County village councilors in cooperation with the KAWESO and Water Committees in each source.
Every woman user will make a small contribution to the maintenance of the infrastructure.

Project requirements have been met by the 4 Village Government Resolutions held by involving members of the KAWESO Organization. The WDC has also approved the plan. This was due to lack of water in 4 Bisheke villages due to climate change. water-borne diseases are on the rise, causing problems especially for mothers and children.

The results of the project are expected to increase the water supply for the population in 4 villages in Bisheke County.

Number of patients suffering from waterborne diseases As diarrhea and epilepsy decrease. Also child mortality caused by waterborne diseases will be reduced so that life improves for all people including children, women, men, people with disabilities and the elderly.

The development of the project will take place through five water resource committees in 4 villages in Bisheke County. The water committees through members will make contributions to the repair of water infrastructure.

The meeting was attended by every member and the village leadership. We saw 5 pigs well cared for in a clean Banda made from local materials with a grass roof. Advice and veterinary inputs are available from the ward buana shamba. The group has a good understanding of disease prevention, but of course we must accept the usual risks of a livestock project. They also demonstrated their grasp of likely profits from the business and of the market for pigs, which is very good.
Lalambe is a village with 825 households, 20k from Kasulu. 
We discussed the budget in detail. About 2.5m can be saved by building one or more Banda with local material, avoiding the use of a mabarti roof. Feed has been overpriced by the budget writer. In fact local evidence Benedicto confirms is that palm nut flour is cheaper than pumba. A further saving of 2m can be made on budgeted food.
Benedicto considers the ambition to buy 10 pigs is realistic. He thinks further savings can be made on pig purchases. Clearly the budget was written by someone other than a group member. I have asked for the contact details.
Benedicto advises that in the first phase of development (say, the first year at least)the group members should continue to do all the pig rearing themselves and not employ a worker. I agree and recommend that this is a condition of funding.
This is a well led group including two members with previous experience of pig rearing. The project will contribute to the incomes of 20 families with more than 100 total beneficiaries. With Benedicto’s support I recommend a grant of £1935.

When we had not heard from AP at the September 2019 meeting, it was agreed to pay the Project from TDT funds. The money was transferred in October 2019. ","REDESA is a well established organisation that provides Entrepreneurship and Vocational Training to young people who leave school with limited educational attainment. In 2015 TDT provided a grant to purchase dressmaking/tailoring and carpentry equipment. Their trainees have done well with a significant number setting up their own businesses or becoming directly employed.
They have been renting a classroom, but have now made a further application for the materials for 2 buildings - one will provide a classroom, store, garments shop and office and the other will be toilets. The current room they rent is too small, insecure to store equipment, has no electricity and the landlord has just doubled the rent. 
A key element of their plan is that the new building will enable them to formally register as a Vocational Training Centre  with VETA (Tanzanian Vocational Education and Training Authority) as it will be within their specifications. This will enable them to award VETA certificates to their students and significantly enhance their employment prospects.
The Local Representative(Godfrey Makenzi) is very positive about this organisation and they have strong links with the District Council (who gave them a contract to build 200 desks) One of their committee members is an engineer with considerable construction experience and he will oversee the building work.
Overall this is a good application from a organisation that helps an often neglected group. This second phase will help them establish themselves on a much firmer footing and significantly increase the young people's employment prospects. It also makes good business sense in that, in the medium term, they will save money. I would strongly recommend that this project is funded.

TDT supported them with a grant of £3000 in May '18 following a visit from KC. Ref # 632.This was mainly used to buy office equipment for their entrepreneurship training.  This is a second application requesting support to buy equipment to make 'fancy interlocking bricks for driveways' and 'plastic flowers' from recycled materials.
Their application is muddled but the concept is good.  Did not hear any evidence about research, marketing or sustainability of the bricks with regard to reacting to climate conditions.  The bricks consist of melted plastic and sand compressed in a mould. As Carshia commented " he had doubts about sustainability and technical know-how".  We also had concern about the financial aspects of the NGO and the way they charge the groups to support themselves and the NGO. Apart from charging each group member a fee to belong, each group has to pay Y4SED 20,000/= a week from the proceeds of anything they sell.
Their administration was poor, and they were unable to show us any records or receipts for purchases and sales made by the groups etc.
Nelson , the CEO, had not responded to any of my messages or emails and Carshia eventually tracked him down in Dar. He flew back to Dodoma for our meeting.
He explained that Y4SED now have a contract importing cars from Japan, for which they receive a commission, so  they are now financially stable.
There is no doubt from the groups we met, Y4SED is giving good support to several disadvantaged youth groups in Dodoma, but they do not require extra support from TDT.

Kevin also asked for a final check on the bank account number which differed from the original by one digit.Hamza subsequently confirmed the bank account number.","NODIP is a small community development organisation based in Ntuntu ward in Singida region.  It is assisted by a dedicated young graduate called Hamza Rajabu. We helped NODIP last year to buy sewing machines and run a training course for young women. This was successful. All the women are now earning small incomes from the sale of clothes they make themselves. I met the young women in February together with village leaders. I saw the women at work on the sewing machines and met their trainer. They have now been able to reduce the time they spend in the wretched pombe bars in the village where they are vulnerable.  They were proud of their new skills and their achievements. NODIP wants to build on this success by purchasing 3 knitting machines, 3 computers, a printer, solar power and motors for all the equipment at a total cost of £3,039. Of this amount, £726 would be the cost of sourcing 3 new computers in Singida. A 6 months' knitting training programme would cost £1,088 for a cohort of 20 young women. They also want to begin a honey producing project and have asked for £1,150 to buy 40 hives and other bee keeping paraphenalia.  An amount of £609 has also been requested for monitoring, evaluation and financial audit. At the time of writing this report I have not been able to find out how certain the supply of computers would be from another source such as Computers for Africa, nor what the costs would be. This is a well led organisation doing sound development work in several poor villages where abuse of young women in lots of small pombe houses is a serious issue. However, I think its capacity is limited. Accordingly I recommend that we do not support the request for beehives at this time.

Construction of water project Village Kagondo, Ruhija village. The project will include the construction of a 2,000 meter drainage pipeline, the purchase of 2,000 meters of water pipes and their connectors, the construction of the plumbing, the construction of two  water tap distribution points.
This project was developed by the Citizens of Ruhija, after a severe water crisis. 
After construction of a water project from the neighboring village of Mikoni, villagers in Ruhija village decided to make plans to draw water from the project ending in Kazilanuka village.
The aim of this project is to facilitate clean and safe water supply to about 1,213 citizens of the Ruhija suburb, so that citizens do not have to spend much time looking for water services but to spend that time on economic activities.Sorry again for the late reply. I would like to answer your questions as follows: 
The water will come from a good supply at Kazilanuka and travel to Ruhija by gravity. i.e. without pump.
This project aims to serve 1,213 people.
The project will be managed by a Ruhija neighborhood water committee consisting of 12 members, consisting of 6 women and 6 men.
The project will provide clean and safe water.   This will lead to improved sanitation, decreased diarrhea, decreased time to access water and some households have access to home water.
Once this water project is completed it will be under the supervision of the neighborhood water committee. The committee will be responsible for reporting revenue and expenditure, based on proceeds from the sale of the water.
The budget request to TDT is for the purchase of materials - Tshs 13,280,750 (£4,390) .  the village / community contribution Tshs 4,250,00 is for the trenching, pipeline laying and back filling.
 All operating costs will be borne by the beneficiaries / citizens. These costs include operation as well as maintenance.
If this project needs to be expanded, the cost of the expansion will be attributed to community contributions in general.
1. The total budget sent, Tshs 17,530,000  includes a community contribution. The amount requested from TDT  13,280,750  
2. This quotation applies if the materials are not procured by the District Council or a Contractor employed by the Council, but by the people who will be onsite coordinating and taking part in the works. 
If this project needs to be expanded, the cost of the expansion will be attributed to community contributions in general.


","This is a project to construct a pipeline to Ruhija Village, Kagondo in Bukoba District.  The overall budget for the project is Tshs 17,530,000 for the purchase of pipes, digging of trench, pipe laying and backfilling  from Kazilanuka to Ruhija and the construction of two water tap points in the village.
The request to TDT is for Tshs 13,280,750 for the purchase of materials for the pipeline and water points construction.  The community contribution is Tshs 4,250,000 for the labour for trench excavation, laying the pipes and backfilling.  Water will flow from a reliable source in Kazifanuka village - 1.5 kms, by gravity so no pump maintenance or costs are required.

Although the lack of nursing care remains an unresolved issue, these works would make a big improvement in the lives of the 40 old people who live in this run down and neglected Council home.  I recommend a full grant of £9,305.  I suggest that we fund room renovation, mattresses and TV ourselves at a cost of £5,304 as these elements will have an immediate impact on the quality of life of the old people.  I suggest that we seek external funding for the toilets and showers block. PREVIOUS REPORT BEGINS HERE: I visited this old people's home in Kigoma with Prosper, the District Council Community Development Officer, in January 2019 at Evelyn Leonard's request.  It is home to 43 people, some of them very badly disabled by leprosy, who have no family to house them. Its existence and its condition came as a shock to me.  Both the fabric of the buildings and the care standards are very poor. For example, I found one old man in bed with bad sores. There was no staff member to nurse him or even to turn him in bed in order to treat the sores. I informed the DED (Alex) and he promised to raise the need for care with the DMO. I told Prosper that the man needed to go immediately to hospital as the sores were infected.The original request was for funding to build two toilets, two bathrooms and to instal a water storage tank. Existing facilities are so disgusting that the old people do not use them - they simply go into the bushes. The Committee deferred this application in May 2019 and invited a second application which also addressed the poor standards in the bedrooms. The project will be implemented through Hope of the Community Foundation, Evelyn's NGO. At my request she submitted a revised budget with much lower costs. I recommend a grant of .

District leaders said that this village is the one in most urgent need of a clean water supply now that TDT has helped to solve the water supply problem in Kinyika.  Currently women draw water from a swamp in the wet season and walk 14k in the dry season to the nearest water source. A low cost hand dug borehole is not an option for Isanjandugu because the water table is low and there is a thick layer of rock. The main costs are to drill a borehole 100 metres in depth and to install 'casings'. I have not visited the village but Dan Cook went in 2018 and Wilhard Titus, our representative, has been twice.

Evidence is on the database of a well attended village conference held in January 2019 to discuss the application.

",NULL,3,4,"oil palm press, banda, equipment","TDT Applications: 727 and 728

Funding request to support the purchase of ‘inner’ oil palm nut cracking machines and materials for building a shed to house them.

TDT originally received one application, for 2, motorised nut cracking machines to extract the ‘inner’ kernel oil. This is for 2 different groups in Mahembe.  I separated these 2 applications to administer more clearly.
727 Sonza Wileme Group and 
728 Ishimwe Women’s Group, both in the village of Mahembe, Kigoma.  

TDT supported Ishimwe last year (£400) with a hand press for the outer nut Ref. # 644.  Kevin visited and saw this in operation in January ‘19.

Having discussed this with Kevin, he put me in contact with Prosper, Kigoma CDO who has been very helpful giving advice about the 2 groups and the advantages and costs involved of these machines.
In summary:
728 Have a hand press to extract oil from the outer husk.  They want a motorised crusher to extract the inner kernel oil
727 do not have any press but want to buy in nuts that have already had the initial press, and use the motorised crusher to extract the kernel oil.

The outer oil is sold at approx. 30,000/= per litre and the inner oil approx. 45,000/=
Both groups are asking fro the same machine.  They are not willing/able to share.  I have some doubts that the machines can be adequately maintained.

According to Prosper the machines proposed are made locally at a cost of approx. 10 million shillings.  Both groups have budgeted for 15 million.

Kevin says this is a very poor area and Mahembe is a large village.  There is a large commercial palm oil producer in the village.

I have queried the high level of community contribution expected. Kevin: On 13 December 2019 I received a letter from Faraja Malinga, Planning officer for Busega District, via Salumu at FODEO. The letter said that the District has raised 25m from the community (6m), P4R Government (12m), CDCF (5m) and Council's own sources 1.5m.  They need 15m from TDT to build two new classrooms as the total budget is 40m for two classrooms. They have downsized their origins plan to build 3 classrooms for 60m. Kevin writes on 19 March 2020: I have decided to fund the school directly rather than FODEO.  Ezekiel has some doubts about Salumu the Mkurugenzi of FODEO. Here are the school bank details: NMB, PO12 Magu, Mtaa wa Benki, Isuka Primary School, Account 31203700173 Swift code NMIBTZTZ.","I visited Isuka primary school in February 2019 with Salumu from FODEO and the DED of Busega District.  The DED told me that this primary school is his priority in the district because most children are being taught under the trees. Three classrooms built some years ago by the community have been condemned as unsafe.  Indeed I saw large cracks in the walls and ceilings.  I also saw children sitting at desks under the trees (photo on db). This is clearly a big problem when there is wind or rain.  The school is about 6k from Nyashimo town in an arid, dusty area.  The Total budget for 2 classrooms in 40m.  The Planning Officer for Busega, a diligent man called Faraja Maliga, wrote to me in December 2019 explaining that the District has now assembled 25m from 4 sources : 6.1m (community), 12.5m (P4R central govt), 4.8m (CDCF Central Govt) and 1.5m (Busega District Council).  They are asking TDT to award 15m.  These rural children face great disadvantage as a result of the lack of classrooms. 2 new classrooms will make a difference. Whilst I would not usually support the use of our funds for primary school classrooms in this case the need is severe if not extraordinary. What's more the poor community served by the school has made a big contribution and the energetic Planning Officer at the Council has brought in funds from three other sources.

Application:
To complete 1 wing with 3 classrooms (already up to lintel height)

PG visited with LR, Wilhard Titus in March 2020.  Met with Headmaster, other staff and Chair of Mwmbeni street area.  Mr. Salutali Joachim was extremely helpful and enthusiastic.

The school has a good complement of teachers – 28? Due to the high number of children, they teach in 2 shifts per day (a.m. and p.m.) but are still doing well in the League Tables.

They showed us the current classroom situation.  There is one block , originally constructed with mud bricks, they have now condemned and no longer use.  I discussed the possibility of renovating but they dismissed this idea.
Classrooms in use are basic but have chalk boards, and some furniture, much of which was donated by NMB Bank, Manyoni.

The Community, have over a long period of time, donated funds to assist with the building of 2 new wings, each with 3 classrooms.  The DED directed the roofing materials be provided by the Forestry Commission.  (This already happened for one wing, but they still have to secure timber for the other wing) 

The school have contracted for the initial building which has been completed in both wings up to lintel height.  More available funds through the Community have also enabled part roofing of one of these.  
The TDT application is requesting assistance to complete the unfinished and un-roofed wing for the sum of 16 million TZS.  So far, for the one wing, the local contribution is around 12 million shillings.

During discussions, it was decided that certain items be reduced in their budget as below.  This includes the possibility of further sponsorship from NMB or similar, for the desks and furniture required.

Wilhard Titus will be able to monitor this project should the Committee be able to accept and go ahead with funding.

Total is approx. 3250 UK Pounds excluding desks and window glass.  I recommend funding this",1015,NULL,2020-04-30,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,https://onedrive.live.com/?id=F58F41920BFFDE6E%218739&cid=F58F41920BFFDE6E,,NULL,"2020-05-05 20:00:32",5558.0000,ApplicationstotheTanzaniaDevelopmentTrust

This is an NGO, new to TDT.  They are well established and good community development experience.  Their application is to promote orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) for improved nutrition and IGA . Staff are committed and several attended training in foood processing and cultivation of OFSP.
Although widely grown there is a lack of understanding on the nutritional benefits with improved varieties especially within the vulnerable groups they are already working with. e.g. women headed households and youth.
They intend to dry the crop with solar driers to maintain the nutritional quality and increase it's marketability.
Their application was to start working with 6 separate groups.  We discussed with them that it is better to start with just 1 or 2 groups to prove the success of the concept which William will be able to monitor.  This means a considerable scaling down from their original application.  I would like to recommend that we support CEDO with this application for the sum of £1550 which will enable them to start with 2 groups, each growing 1 acre of OFSP.

The principals are known personally to me and they are honest and genuine in their endeavours to improve lives in Lindi.
Their most recent larger project was the construction of a block of toilets in the largest primary school in Lindi town. This came in on time and on budget. Organising committees were disbanded at the outset and both materials purchase and works were closely monitored. I have ben in contact with READ International who are positive about being able to contribute further funds to finish the refurb. The funds requested would only make good the roof, ceilings and pay for glass windows. The remaining works which were costed in the original application would enable full use to be made of the large number of children's books in storage, as well as the computers which have been donated previously but are not in use due to the current condition of the library.
I met the new librarian who has a very refreshing outlook on how the library should be run to attract more children to use facilities.
